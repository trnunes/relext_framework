  SENTENCES: '''Tommy Steele''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born '''Thomas William Hicks''', 17 December 1936, [[Bermondsey]], London), is an English  entertainer.Steele is widely regarded as [[United Kingdom|Britain's]] first [[teen idol]] and [[rock and roll]] star.<refname "NME Rock 'N' Roll Years"></ref>

 
 
Before landing a singing career, Steele tried his hand at a number of odd jobs and had a brief spell as a [[Merchant shipping|merchant seaman]].Like many singers of his era he never did [[National Service]], having failed the medical examination because, at eighteen years old, he was diagnosed as suffering with [[cardiomyopathy]].However, according to his autobiography, ''Bermondsey Boy: Memories of a Forgotten World'', he failed the medical because he had [[flat feet]].While on leave or during [[dock (maritime)|dock]] [[Strike action|strike]]s, he played guitar and [[banjo]] and sang in [[The 2i's Coffee Bar]] and The Cat's Whisker where hand-jiving was devised, two coffee houses in [[Soho]], both as a solo performer and with [[Wally Whyton]]'s [[Vipers Skiffle Group]].When a ship Steele was serving on docked in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], he heard [[Buddy Holly]] and fell in love with rock and roll, turning his back on the British [[skiffle]] craze.He was discovered by freelance photographer John Kennedy, who believed Steele could be Britain's answer to [[Elvis Presley]].Later co-manager [[Larry Parnes]] was incorrectly credited with creating the stage name 'Tommy Steele.'It was Steele who adapted the surname of his Scandinavian paternal grandfather, Thomas Stil-Hicks (pronounced Steel-Hicks), adding another E to the spelling.Steele shot quickly to fame in the UK as the frontman for a [[rock and roll]] band, the Steelmen, after their first single, "Rock With The Caveman," reached number 13 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1956.Steele and other British singers would pick known [[hit record]]s from the United States, record their [[cover version]]s of these songs, and release them in the UK before the American versions could enter the charts.Most of Steele's 1950s recordings were covers of American hits, such as "[[Singing the Blues]]" and "[[Knee Deep in the Blues]]".Although Steele never proved a serious threat to Presley's popularity in the UK, he did well on the 1950s UK chart and "Singing the Blues" got to [[List_of_number-one_singles_from_the_1950s_%28UK%29#1957|Number 1]] in the UK before Presley did so.<refname "NME Rock 'N' Roll Years 7"></ref> 

In late 2009 his [[greatest hits]] collection, ''The Very Best of Tommy Steele'', reached the [[Top 40]] in the [[UK Albums Chart]].This was the first UK chart entry, of any kind, that Steele had enjoyed for over forty eight years.<ref>[http://www.everyhit.com/searchsec.phpEveryhit.com]- accessed May 2010</ref>

 
The increase in home-grown musical talent during the 1960s allowed Steele to progress to a career in stage and film musicals, leaving behind his pop idol identity.In the [[West End theatre|West End]] he appeared in the title role of ''[[Hans Christian Andersen]]''.On film, he recreated his London and Broadway stage role in ''[[Half A Sixpence]]'', and played character roles in ''[[The Happiest Millionaire]]'' and ''[[Finian's Rainbow (film)|Finian's Rainbow]]'', although many critics found his personality to be somewhat overwhelming on screen.In this latter film, probably his best known appearance in the movies, he played Og, the [[leprechaun]] turning human, and co-starred with [[Petula Clark]] and [[Fred Astaire]].In April 1971, Steele starred in his own show ''Meet Me in London'' at London's [[Adelphi Theatre]].<refname="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years 8"></ref> 

In 1983, Steele directed and starred in the [[West End theatre|West End]] stage production of ''[[Singin' in the Rain (musical)|Singin' in the Rain]]'' at the [[London Palladium]].In 1991 he toured with [[Sugar (musical)|''Some Like It Hot'']] the stage version of the [[Jack Lemmon]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]] film.In 2003, after a decade-long hiatus, save his one man shows ''An Evening With Tommy Steele'' and ''What A Show!'',  he toured as [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] in a production of ''[[Scrooge (musical)|Scrooge: The Musical]]'', an adaptation of ''[[Scrooge (1970 film)|Scrooge]]''.Following this return, he reprised his role at the [[Palace Theatre, Manchester]] over Christmas 2004, and brought the production to the London Palladium for Christmas 2005.In 2008, at the age of 71, Steele toured in the lead role of the stage musical ''[[Doctor Dolittle (film)|Doctor Dolittle]]'', and reprised his role as ''Scrooge'' during the Christmas season in 2009.He will play the part once again in [http://www.grandcanaltheatre.ie/eventDetail.aspx?mid 97 Dublin in winter 2010].He also played Scrooge in the Sunderland Empire Theatre in October 2010, [[Hull New Theatre]], [[His Majesty's Theatre]] and [[Edinburgh Playhouse]] in November 2010.He is again touring the UK in his starring role as Scrooge in 2011.In the early 1980s, Steele wrote and published a book titled ''The Final Run'', a novel about World War II and the evacuation of [[Dunkirk evacuation|Dunkirk]].He also wrote a children's novel, entitled ''Quincy'', about a reject toy trying to save himself and his fellow rejects in the basement of a toy store from the furnace the day after Christmas.This was turned into a film in 1979, in which Steele played Quincy and [[Mel Martin]] played Quincy's girlfriend doll, Rebecca.He is a respected [[sculptor]] and three of his major works have been on public display: ''Bermondsey Boy'' at the [[Rotherhithe]] Civic Centre (which was subjected to an arson attack by local youths some years ago and no longer exists), and ''Eleanor Rigby'' which he sculpted and gave to the [[Liverpool|City of Liverpool]] as a tribute to [[The Beatles]].The statue stands in [[Stanley Street, Liverpool]], not far from [[The Cavern Club]].Steele has another sculpture featuring two [[Rugby football|rugby]] players on display at [[Twickenham Stadium]].He is also an artist of some note and has exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]].Steele is mentioned briefly in Ian Fleming's James Bond novel, Thunderball.Fleming (as Bond) viewed Steele as a modern post-war youth, existing in a world with atomic bombs, space flight, and the Welfare State.Steele's autobiography was published in September 2006 and is entitled ''Bermondsey Boy: Memories of a Forgotten World'' (London: Joseph) ISBN 0-7181-4972-6

Steele co-wrote many of his early songs with Lionel Bart and Mike Pratt, but he used the pseudonym of Jimmy Bennett from 1958 onwards.<ref>[http://www.free-scores.com/boutique/1356-Lionel-Bart-digital-sheet-music.htmDigital Sheet Music website]</ref>

 
Steele married Ann Donoghue at St. Patrick's Catholic Church, Soho Square, London, in 1960.They have one daughter, Emma.For many years it was thought that [[Elvis Presley]] had never set foot in England, and had only ever spent a few minutes on the [[tarmac]] at [[Prestwick Airport]] in Scotland where his military plane, en route to the United States after completing his military service in West Germany, stopped to re-fuel.However, on 21 April 2008, in a [[BBC Radio 2]] interview with theatre impresario [[Bill Kenwright]], it was claimed that Presley, then 23, had visited England for a day, after a phone conversation with Steele in London in 1958.According to Kenwright: "Elvis flew in for a day and Tommy showed him round London.He showed him the [[Houses of Parliament]] and spent the day with him".Kenwright admitted on 22 April 2008 that he was not sure whether he should have told the story.Tommy Steele said: “It was two young men sharing the same love of their music.I swore never to divulge publicly what took place and I regret that it has found some way of getting into the light.I only hope he can forgive me."Press officers employed by [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach]], the company that owns Prestwick Airport, rapidly issued a statement requesting proof, photographic or otherwise, of the said meeting.Until such proof is provided, they will continue to describe their property Prestwick Airport as being the only place in Britain where Elvis Presley ever set foot, and will not be removing the marker, photographs and special lounge at their airport which relate to their claim.<ref></ref><ref></ref>Lamar Fike, a former member of the [[Memphis Mafia]], who lived with Presley at the time, has posted a claim [http://www.elvisinfonet.com] that it was he, not Presley, who visited London and Tommy Steele for a day in 1958.Partial discography.<ref>[http://www.tommysteeleinternationalfanclub.com/TOMMYSTEELEDISCOGRAPHY.htmTommy Steele Discography] Accessed February 2007.</ref>'''With the Steelmen'''

  SENTENCES: '''Thomas Baptiste "Tom" Morello''' (born May 30, 1964) is a [[Grammy Award]]-winning [[United States|American]] [[guitarist]] best known for his tenure with the bands [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[Audioslave]], his acoustic solo act ''[[The Nightwatchman]]'', and his newest group, [[Street Sweeper Social Club]].Tom is also the co-founder (along with [[Serj Tankian]]) of the non-profit political activist organization, [[Axis of Justice]], which airs monthly on KPFK 90.7FM in Los Angeles.He is best known for his unique and creative guitar playing style, which incorporates feedback noises, unconventional picking and tapping as well as heavy use of guitar effects.He was ranked #26 in ''Rolling Stone's'' list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time."<ref></ref>Tom Morello was born on May 30, 1964, in [[Harlem, New York]], to [[Ngethe Njoroge]] and [[Mary Morello]].He is of [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[Italians|Italian]] descent on his maternal side, and [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] [[Kenyan]] descent on his paternal side.His mother was a schoolteacher from [[Marseilles, Illinois]], who earned a [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|Master of Arts]] at [[Loyola University, Chicago]] and travelled to [[Germany]], [[Spain]], [[Japan]], and [[Kenya]] as an [[English language]] teacher between 1977 to 1983.<refname "oneman">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tom-matlack/tom-morello-one-man-revol_b_245035.htmlTom Morello:One Man Revolt] by ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', July 21, 2009</ref> After discovering her pregnancy, Mary returned to the [[United States]] with Njoroge in November, and married in [[New York City]].When Morello was 16 months old, Njoroge returned to his native Kenya, and denied his paternity of his son.<refname "phoenix_nt_1996"></ref> Morello was raised solely by his mother in [[Libertyville, Illinois]], a suburb of [[Chicago]].There he attended [[Libertyville High School]], where his mother was a U.S. history teacher.She was the homeroom teacher for Tom's classmate and fellow guitarist [[Adam Jones (musician)|Adam Jones]], of the band [[Tool (band)|Tool]], while teaching at Libertyville.Tom sang in the school choir and was active in speech and drama club 

Morello developed leftist political leanings early, and has described himself as having been "the only anarchist in a conservative high school", and has since identified as a nonsectarian [[socialist]].In the 1980 mock elections at Libertyville, he campaigned for a fictitious [[anarchist]] "candidate" named Hubie Maxwell, who came in fourth place in the election.He also wrote a piece headlined "South Africa: Racist Fascism That We Support" for the school alternative newspaper ''The Student Pulse''.Morello graduated from high school with honors in June 1982, and enrolled at [[Harvard University]] as a [[political science]] student that autumn.He was the first student at his high school to be accepted at Harvard, and was in fact the first person from Libertyville, Illinois ever to enroll there.<refname "Tom Morello Used To Be A Stripper"></ref> 
<blockquote>"When I graduated from Harvard and moved to Hollywood, I was unemployable.I was literally starving, so I had to work menial labour and, at one point, I even worked as an exotic dancer.'Brick House' (by [[The Commodores]]) was my jam!I did bachlorette parties and I'd go down to my boxer shorts.Would I go further?All I can say is thank God it was in the time before YouTube!You could make decent money doing that job – people do what they have to do.<ref name="Tom Morello Used To Be A Stripper"/> " </blockquote>

From 1987 to 1988, Morello worked in the office of California Democratic Senator [[Alan Cranston]] 
<blockquote>"I never had any real desire to work in politics but if there was any ember burning in me, it was extinguished working in that job because of two things: one of them was the fact that 80 per cent of the time I spent with the Senator, he was on the phone asking rich people for money.It just made me understand that the whole business was dirty.He had to compromise his entire being every day.The other was the time a woman phoned up to the office and wanted to complain that there were Mexicans moving into her neighborhood.I said to her, 'Ma'am, you're a damn racist,' and she was indignant.I thought I was representing our cause well, but I got yelled at for a week by everyone for saying that!I thought to myself that if I'm in a job where I can't call a damn racist a damn racist, then it's not for me.<refname="Tom Morello Used To Be A Stripper"/> "</blockquote>

 
At age 13, Morello joined his first band 

At the time, Morello's musical tastes lay in the direction of hard rock and heavy metal, particularly [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Iron Maiden]].As he stated in Flight 666 he is a huge fan of [[Piece of Mind]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Led Zeppelin]], and [[Black Sabbath]].Morello developed his own unique sound through the electric guitar.Later, his musical style and politics were greatly influenced by punk rock bands like [[The Clash]], [[The Sex Pistols]], and [[Devo]].In 1991 Tom was looking to form an old band after Lock Up disbanded.Tom was impressed by [[Zack de la Rocha]]'s freestyle rapping and asked him to join his band.He also drafted drummer [[Brad Wilk]], who he knew from his band Lock Up, where Wilk unsuccessfully auditioned for a drumming spot.The band's lineup was completed when Zack convinced his childhood friend [[Tim Commerford]] to play bass.After frequenting the L.A. club circuit, Rage Against the Machine signed a record deal with [[Epic Records]] in 1992.That same year, the band released their [[Rage Against the Machine (album)|self titled debut]].They achieved a considerable amount of mainstream success and released three more studio albums.In August 2000 in Los Angeles during the Democratic National Convention, Rage Against the Machine performed outside the Staples Center to a large crowd numbering in the thousands while the Convention took place inside.<ref></ref>After several audience members began to throw rocks, the Los Angeles Police Department turned off the power and ordered the audience to disperse, firing rubber bullets and pepper spray into the crowd.<ref></ref>[[Image:tommorello01.jpg|thumb|left|Tom Morello performing with [[Rage against the machine|Rage Against The Machine]] at the [[Reading festival#2008|2008 Reading Festival]]]]

In late 2000, after [[MTV Video Music Awards#2000s|Commerford's stunt at the VMA's]], the disgruntled de la Rocha quit the band.On September 13, 2000, Rage Against the Machine performed their last concert at the [[Grand Olympic Auditorium]] in Los Angeles.After the band disbanded, their fourth studio album, ''[[Renegades (Rage Against the Machine album)|Renegades]]'', became a collection of cover songs from artists such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[MC5]], [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Cypress Hill]].2003 saw the release of their last album, titled ''[[Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium]]'', an edited recording of the band's final two concerts on September 12 and 13, 2000 at the Grand Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles.It was accompanied by an expanded DVD release of the last show and included a previously unreleased music video for "Bombtrack".After disbanding, Morello, Wilk and Commerford went on to form Audioslave with former [[Soundgarden]] singer [[Chris Cornell]], and released three albums as well as a DVD from the band's concert in [[Cuba]].De la Rocha started working on a solo album collaboration with [[DJ Shadow]], [[Company Flow]], and [[The Roots]]' [[Questlove]], but the project was dropped in favor of working with [[Nine Inch Nail]]s' [[Trent Reznor]].Recording was completed, but the album will probably never be released.<ref></ref>So far, only one track has been released: "We Want It All" was featured on "Songs and Artists that Inspired [[Fahrenheit 9/11]]".On April 29, 2007, Rage Against the Machine reunited at the [[Coachella Music Festival]].The band played in front of an [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|EZLN]] backdrop to the largest crowds of the festival.The performance was initially thought to be a one-off, but this turned out not to be the case.The band played 7 more shows in the United States in 2007 (including their first non-festival concert in 7 years at the [[Alpine Valley Music Theater]] in [[East Troy, Wisconsin]]), and in January 2008, they played their first shows outside the US since re-forming as part of the [[Big Day Out]] Festival in Australia and New Zealand.In August 2008 they headlined nights at the Reading and Leeds festivals.<ref></ref><ref></ref>The band has since continued to tour around the world, headlining many large festivals in Europe and the United States, including [[Lollapalooza]] in [[Chicago]].In 2008 the band also played shows in [[Denver, Colorado]] and [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] to coincide with the [[2008 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] and [[2008 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]], respectively.In July, 2011, Rage Against the Machine played at L.A. Rising, a concert formed by the band in Los Angeles, in which they headlined and played with other artists including Muse and Rise Against.Though they played together for these events, they do not play together regularly.[[Image:Tom Morello Montreux Jazz Festival 2005.jpg|thumb|170px|Morello with Audioslave at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 2005.]]After de la Rocha left Rage Against the Machine, the remaining band mates began collaborating with former [[Soundgarden]] vocalist [[Chris Cornell]] at the suggestion of producer [[Rick Rubin]].The new group was first rumored to be called The Civilian Project, but the name Audioslave was confirmed before their first album was released.The band released their eponymous debut album on November 19, 2002.It was a critical and commercial success, attaining triple-platinum status.The band released their second album, ''[[Out of Exile]]'', on May 24, 2005.It debuted at number 1 on the Billboard charts and attained platinum status.In the same year, they released a DVD documenting their trip as the first American rock band to play a free show in [[Cuba]].The band's third album, ''[[Revelations (Audioslave album)|Revelations]]'', was released in the fall of 2006.As of February 15, 2007, Audioslave have broken up as a result of frontman Cornell's departure due to "irresolvable personality conflicts".The band reunited with Zack de la Rocha and resumed their previous band, Rage Against the Machine.Morello is less known for his [[folk music]], which he plays under the alias The Nightwatchman.He has explained:



In November 2003 The Nightwatchman joined artists [[Billy Bragg]], [[Lester Chambers]] of [[The Chambers Brothers]], [[Steve Earle]], [[Jill Sobule]], [[Boots Riley]] of [[The Coup]] and [[Mike Mills]] of [[R.E.M.]] on the Tell Us the Truth Tour.The thirteen-city tour was supported by unions, environmental and media reform groups including Common Cause, Free Press and A.F.L.-C.I.O. with the ultimate goal of "informing music fans, and exposing and challenging the failures of the major media outlets in the United States."<ref>Portner,Matt and Heller, Sarah.[http://www.thestudentunderground.org/article.php?id 46 Tell Us the Truth Tour.''The Boston Underground''] retrieved 12/14/2007</ref>  Tom Morello explained:
<blockquote>

"Media consolidation needs smashing and globalization needs unmasking.When presidents and politicians lie, it is the job of the press to expose those lies.When the press fails, the gangstas come out from hiding.The lie becomes the law.The point of the Tell Us the Truth Tour is to help others make connections, and to show them that activism can change the policies of this country."<ref>Nichols,John.[http://www.thenation.com/blogs/thebeat?pid=1069Tell Us The Truth!] ''The Nation.''retrieved 12/14/2007</ref>

In 2011 it was announced that Morello would write a new 12-issue comic book series for [[Dark Horse Comics]], entitled ''Orchid.''The series is a post-apocalyptic story in which the title character is "a teenage prostitute who learns that she is more than the role society has imposed upon her."The first issue was published in October 2011, and Morello is releasing an exclusive new song to accompany each issue.''Orchid'' is illustrated by Canadian artist Scott Hepburn.<ref>[http://www.darkhorse.com/Comics/16-912/Orchid-1-Massimo-Carnevale-cover''Orchid'' solicitation page] at Dark Horse website.</ref>The release party sponsored by Dark Horse was held at [[Jetpack Comics]] in [[Rochester, New Hampshire]] on October 12, 2011.<ref>[http://www.darkhorse.com/Blog/627/rock-your-local-comic-book-shop-win-release-party]</ref>[[Image:Whatever It Takes.jpg|thumb|"Whatever it takes", a classical acoustic guitar used by Morello in his The Nightwatchman persona.]]Morello is famed for his [[guitar]] style, which consists of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]/[[punk music|punk]] hybrid [[riff]]s and [[hip hop music|hip hop]]-inspired sounds.A 1993 [[Melody Maker]] live review of a Rage Against The Machine gig, said ''Guitarist Tom Morello wears his guitar high up to wring every sound out of it.Falling bombs, police sirens, scratching - he can do them all.''<ref>Melody Maker - 29th May 1993 issue</ref>

To produce his alien guitar sounds, Morello chooses various effects pedals.During his tenure in RATM, he used a [[Dunlop Cry Baby]], a [[DigiTech Whammy|DigiTech WH-1 Whammy]], a [[Boss Corporation|Boss]] DD-2 Digital Delay, a DOD EQ pedal (set flat and just used to boost the volume during guitar solos or particular rocking moments), and an Ibanez DFL Flanger.Around the time of ''[[The Battle of Los Angeles (album)|The Battle of Los Angeles]]'' he added a Boss TR-2 Tremolo pedal (which can be heard on "Guerrilla Radio").For Audioslave, Morello replaced the Ibanez Flanger with a [[MXR Phase 90]].His amplifier of choice has always been a 50-watt Marshall JCM 800 2205 and a [[Peavey Electronics|Peavey]] 4x12 cabinet.Though the Marshall is his amp of choice with Rage Against the Machine, he used a Vox AC30 combo amplifier for multiple overdubs on Audioslave's album ''Revelations''.While the Marshall amplifier has two channels, he only uses the overdrive channel, and simply turns down the volume on his guitar to get cleaner sounds.In the studio, Morello uses the same setup for the bulk of the guitar tracks.For ''The Battle of Los Angeles'', he also used a few other amps, such as a Line 6 as heard on the clean, spacey intro of "Mic Check", plus a Pignose mini-amp and a MusicMan "Twin" style amp.<ref>TomMorello [http://www.musicfanclubs.org/rage/articles/testify.htmRadical Shriek].musicfanclubs.org.</ref>During the recording of Audioslave's last album, ''[[Revelations (Audioslave album)|Revelations]]'', Morello experimented with different amplifier setups.For the title track's solo he split his signal to his standard Marshall 2205 head and Peavey cabinet and a 100 watt [[Fender Bassman]] head and an [[Orange Music Electronic Company|Orange cabinet]].With delay sent to one while the other is unaffected the sound is being "ping-ponged" between the two amplifiers.He also borrowed a [[VOX AC30]] amplifier from producer Brendan O’Brien for some tracks.<ref></ref>Morello's unique technique and talent led to him being voted the fifth greatest guitarist of the past 30 years in a 2010 BBC poll.<ref></ref>[[File:Day 28 Occupy Wall Street Tom Morello 2011 Shankbone 6.JPG|thumb|Morello playing [[Occupy Wall Street]] in New York, October 2011]]On August 27, 2008 Morello performed in [[Denver, Colorado]] at the Open The Debates rally in opposition to the [[Commission on Presidential Debates]] exclusion of [[Third party (United States)|third party]] candidates from the nationally televised debates.He performed "[[This Land is Your Land]]" as [[The Nightwatchman]] and endorsed Independent Presidential Candidate [[Ralph Nader]].[[Sean Penn]], [[Jello Biafra]], [[Brooke Smith]] and [[Cindy Sheehan]] were also part of the rally.<ref>''SeanPenn, Val Kilmer, Tom Morello and Cindy Sheehan at Nader/Gonzalez Super Rally in Denver'', VoteNader.org,August 19, 2008 [http://www.votenader.org/media/2008/08/19/DenverRally3/]</ref>In October 2009, Morello, among a number of musicians, sued the US government for the declassification of all documents relating to the use of music in interrogations at Guantanamo Bay.He stated, "Guantanamo is known around the world as one of the places where human beings have been tortured -- from waterboarding to stripping, hooding and forcing detainees into humiliating sexual acts -- playing music for 72 hours in a row at volumes just below that to shatter the eardrums.Guantanamo may be Dick Cheney's idea of America, but it's not mine.The fact that music I helped create was used in crimes against humanity sickens me."<ref>''US bands blast use of music in Guantanamo interrogations'', October 22, 2009 [http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/usattacksguantanamomusicprisoners]</ref><ref name="bbc-about">

On February 21, 2011 Morello organized and performed an acoustic concert in support of the [[2011 Wisconsin protests|protests]] over collective bargaining rights in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison, WI]].The concert also featured [[The MC5]]'s [[Wayne Kramer (guitarist)|Wayne Kramer]] and Boston punk band [[Street Dogs]].He wrote an article in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' about his experience.<ref></ref>Recently, Morello has played at many Occupy movements, including [[Occupy Wall Street]] as well as Occupy Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Vancouver, British Columbia, Nottingham and Newcastle, England protests.[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/occupy-wall-street-protests-tom-morello-260993]Morello and [[Serj Tankian]] of [[System of a Down]] are the co-founders of [[Axis of Justice]], a political group whose declared purpose is "to bring together musicians, fans of music, and grassroots political organizations to fight for social justice together."They "aim to build a bridge between fans of music around the world and local political organizations to effectively organize around issues of peace, human rights, and economic justice."<ref>[http://www.axisofjustice.net/mission.htmMission].Axis of Justice.</ref>The group has worked for such causes as [[immigration|immigrant rights]] and [[Death penalty|death-penalty]] abolition.Its recommended book list includes such authors as [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Che Guevara]], [[George Orwell]],  [[Mumia Abu-Jamal]] and [[Grant Morrison]].<ref>[http://www.axisofjustice.net/books.htmBooks].Axis of Justice.</ref>Morello and Tankian, together with a handful of other artists, including [[Maynard James Keenan]], [[Wayne Kramer (guitarist)|Wayne Kramer]] of the [[MC5]], the hip hop group [[Jurassic 5]], and [[Michael "Flea" Balzary]] of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], released a live recording of covers and original songs, titled ''The Axis of Justice Concert Series Volume 1''.On April 6, 2006, Tom Morello was honored with the Eleanor Roosevelt Human Rights Award for his support of worker's rights and for his AOJ work.<ref>[http://action.americanrightsatwork.org/aaraw/events/er2006/details.tcl2006 Eleanor Roosevelt Human Rights Awards Celebration].americanrightsatwork.org.</ref>Tom has worked on numerous labor campaigns: the Guess sweatshop boycott, the LA janitors strike, the Taco Bell boycott, the southern California grocery workers strike and lockout, and others.Morello was a strong supporter of the [[Illegal immigration to the United States|Immigrants Reform Rally]] and protest around the US.He feels that there's enough room for everyone in the United States, whether those people want to work or not.Morello played as The Nightwatchman at [[MacArthur Park]] in Los Angeles and has featured many articles on AOJ.On September 28, 2006, Morello was one of 400 protesters arrested protesting in support of immigrant hotel workers' rights, in what organizers called "the largest act of civil disobedience in the history of the Los Angeles".<ref>Moss,Corey with Chris Harris [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1542001/20060928/audioslave.jhtml?headlines=trueTom Morello Arrested At Protest, Spends Night In Lockup].MTV.com, September 2006</ref> Morello knew he was going to be arrested 



 
Tom Morello has a wife with who he has a young son named Rhoads ( 2 ) and a baby boy named Roman ( 7 months ).Morello is a vegan for both health and ethical reasons.<ref></ref><ref></ref>Morello uses heavily modified guitars from various manufacturers, but he has never had an official endorsement deal with any company.Morello's amplifier and effects setup has been practically the same throughout his career in Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave and Street Sweeper Social Club.[[Image:Tom Pedalboard.jpg|thumb|200px|A photo of Morello's pedal board 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 



The Nightwatchman is the alter ego of Tom Morello, guitarist with Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave.While Morello is best known for his bracing mix of hard rock fury with hip-hop accents, as the Nightwatchman he performs as a solo acoustic singer and songwriter, playing self-penned songs that reflect his leftist political beliefs.Born in New York City in 1964 and raised in Libertyville, IL, by his mother (a longtime political activist), Morello taught himself to play guitar while he was a student at Harvard University, where he received a degree in political science.After graduating, Morello moved to Los Angeles and joined a hard rock band called Lock Up, which scored a deal with Geffen Records 

Morello had much better luck with his next project — Rage Against the Machine, which fused hip-hop rhythms and fractured heavy metal guitar sounds alongside Zack de la Rocha's agitprop lyrics.RATM released their first album in 1992, and became one of the most influential bands of the 1990s, blazing the trail for the rap-metal movement and confirming that there was still room for firebrand politics in mainstream rock & roll.Rage Against the Machine split up suddenly in 2000 following the release of their album Renegades, and Morello and his bandmates Tim Commerford and Brad Wilk soldiered on as Audioslave with former Soundgarden vocalist Chris Cornell.In 2003, inspired by Bob Dylan's early work and Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska and outraged by the administration of George W. Bush, Morello began writing topical songs and singing them at informal shows in California coffeehouses.Calling himself the Nightwatchman, Morello admits to having severe stage fright during his first appearances as a vocalist, but before long he gained confidence and in 2004 the Nightwatchman took part in the Tell Us the Truth tour, a series of concerts (also featuring Billy Bragg, Steve Earle, and Boots Riley of the Coup) staged to raise awareness during the 2004 presidential campaign 

A few months later, the Nightwatchman emerged again on Axis of Justice: Concert Series, Vol. 1, another live album drawn from a series of benefit concerts for Axis of Justice, a political activist group founded by Morello and Serj Tankian of System of a Down.Morello continued performing as the Nightwatchman when not busy with Audioslave, and in 2006 he recorded the Nightwatchman's first album, One Man Revolution, produced by Brendan O'Brien and released in April 2007.'''Lock Up'''

  SENTENCES: '''David Russell Gordon "Dave" Davies''' (born 3 February 1947, [[Fortis Green]], London) is an English rock musician best known for his role as lead guitarist and vocalist for the English rock band [[The Kinks]].In 2003, Davies was ranked 88th in ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' magazine list of the "[[Rolling Stone's 100 greatest guitarists of all time|100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time]]"<ref></ref>

Davies was born at 6 Denmark Terrace, Fortis Green, London.<refname "X-Ray">''X-Ray, The Unauthorized Autobiography'', Ray Davies.ISBN 1-58567-939-9, 9781585679393.</ref>Davies grew up playing [[skiffle]], but soon bought an electric guitar and started experimenting with rock.<refname BSlGgpgw4N0C Google Books Listing] ''The complete guide to the music of the Kinks'' By Johnny Rogan, ISBN 0-7119-6314-2</ref>

 

Davies founded The Kinks with Pete Quaife in 1963.His brother [[Ray Davies|Ray]], who became the best-known member and de-facto leader of the band, joined soon after.<refname "Mick Avory Interview">[http://kastoffkinks.co.uk/Mick%20Avory%20interview%20part%201.htmInterview with Mick Avory.]</ref>Ray and Dave Davies remained the only two steady members of the band<ref name 376 Lyrics and Songwriting credits for "Strangers"]</ref>

 
Davies was responsible for the signature distorted [[power chord]] riff on The Kinks' first hit, "[[You Really Got Me]]".<refname "Allmusic Bio"/> especially during the [[Punk rock]] period.Davies later commented



"You Really Got Me" was the group's third released single, after two unsuccessful ones that failed to chart.They had a three (singles) record contract with Pye Records, and needed a hit to get another contract.Pye didn't like the song and refused to pay for studio time.<ref>Storyteller,Koch Records 2006</ref> The band arranged other financial support to cut the single, which became a massive hit, topping the charts in the UK and reaching #7 in the U.S.<ref name="Charts">[http://www.kindakinks.net/charts.htmlwww.kindakinks.net]Chart Positions</ref>

The Kinks released three albums and several [[Extended play|EP]]s in the next two years.They also performed and toured relentlessly, headlining package tours with the likes of [[The Yardbirds]] and [[Mickey Finn]], which caused tension within the band.<refname "All Day">The Kinks: All Day and All of the Night, Day-By-Day Concerts, Recordings, etc., by Doug Hinman</ref> Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other.During the late 1960s the group steadily evolved, as Ray's songwriting skills developed and he began to lead the group in a whole new direction.<refname="Allmusic Bio"/> The group abandoned the traditional R&B/Blues sound and adopted a more nostalgic, reflective style of music, as showcased on songs like "[[Autumn Almanac]]" and "[[Waterloo Sunset]]", as well as their albums, such as ''[[Something Else by The Kinks]]'' and ''[[The Village Green Preservation Society]]''.In July 1967, Davies released his first [[solo (music)|solo]] [[single (music)|single]], credited entirely under his name, (although co-written by his brother and fellow Kinks member Ray Davies) entitled "[[Death of a Clown]]".<ref>[[Death of a clown|Wikipedia entry for Death of a Clown]]</ref> In the past as a member of The Kinks Dave Davies had only released his own compositions on [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] and as part of albums.The Kinks' [[record label]] sensed potential sales in a solo release from the overlooked Davies, and issued "Death of a Clown" as his debut.Although credited to Davies, it was technically a Kinks recording, as his backing band was The Kinks.Upon its release, "Death of a Clown" rose to number three on the [[UK Singles Chart]].Wanting to profit off of the new buzz suddenly surrounding Davies, a solo LP was slated for release some time in 1968 or 1969.<refname "Kink"/>

''[[The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society]]'' and ''[[Arthur (album)|Arthur]]'' were released in 1968 and 1969, respectively.<refname="All Day"/> Although they received unanimous acclaim, ''Village Green'' failed to chart internationally, and ''Arthur'' was met with a mediocre commercial reception.These records, although praised by critics and the rock press,<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thekinks/albums/album/90937/review/6067569/village_green_preservation_societyRolling Stone Review (Period)]</ref> were commercial failures.[[Image:Dave Davies 1971.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=Ayoung, bearded man, wearing a jacket over a striped turtleneck sweater, sits a table presumably in a bar or pub.|Davies in 1971, around the time of ''Muswell Hillbillies'']]
After ''Arthur'', The Kinks made a comeback with their hit single "[[Lola (song)|Lola]]" and the accompanying [[concept album]] ''[[Lola versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One]]'' in 1970.Dave recorded two songs of his own for this LP, the acoustic "[[Strangers (The Kinks song)|Strangers]]" and the hard-rocking "[[Rats (Dave Davies song)|Rats]]".The rootsy country-rock, and Americana themed  ''[[Muswell Hillbillies]]'' was released in late 1971, and was well-received with critics, but failed to sell strongly.This pattern of critical acclaim with less than spectacular commercial success continued with the next albums which added a large theatrical ensemble.''[[Preservation: Act 1]] & [[Preservation: Act 2]]'', ''[[The Kinks Present A Soap Opera]]'' and ''[[Schoolboys in Disgrace]]''.Davies made several attempts at solo albums throughout the '70s, but he never felt enough enthusiasm or interest to see the projects through.He would often act as the producer and engineer at The Kinks' main studio, [[Konk (recording)|Konk]], in his spare time, producing albums for the likes of [[Claire Hamill]] and [[Andy Desmond aka Miten|Andy Desmond]].<ref>[http://time-has-told-me.blogspot.com/2007_01_01_archive.html A blog with details on the track listing and release of this Andy Desmond album.]The entry is a few paragraphs down.</ref>Ray Davies commented on his brother's studio and solo work in a November 1975 interview:



The Kinks left [[RCA records]] in 1977, switching to [[Arista Records|Arista]].<refname "D Davies Interview">"This Man He Laughs Tonight", interview with Dave Davies by Dave Schulps, ''Trouser Press'', August 1980</ref> His composition and earnest, almost desperate lead vocals, not to mention his particularly ripping lead guitar sound, led to airplay - especially on college stations - for his idealistic "Trust Your Heart" on the 1978 ''[[Misfits (The Kinks album)|Misfits]]'' album.[[File:Dave Davies of The Kinks in 1979.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Daviesperforming in 1979]]
Davies would see the group through both success and failure, as they reached their commercial peak in the early 1980s.The group began adjusting their commercial methods, embracing the [[MTV]] culture that was selling records at the time.The music video for their 1982/83 single "[[Come Dancing (song)|Come Dancing]]" helped hoist the record to #12 on the UK charts, and #6 in the U.S - their biggest hit since "[[Tired of Waiting for You]]" in 1965.<refname="Charts"/> The song was a nostalgic look back at childhood memories of the Davies brothers, remembering their elder sisters going out to dance at the local palais, and coming back home to the front room at 6 Denmark Terrace.The Kinks' popularity faltered in 1985, and soon their records ceased to chart altogether.Mick Avory left the band after The Kinks' last album for Arista, ''[[Word of Mouth (The Kinks album)|Word of Mouth]]'', mainly due to the growing animosity between him and Dave Davies.<refname="Mick Avory Interview"/> Ray Davies said that Avory was his best friend in the band and he unwillingly had to choose sides, as said later in a 1989 interview:



[[Bob Henrit]] was brought in to take Avory's place.At Ray Davies' invitation Avory agreed to manage Konk Studios, where he also served as a producer and occasional contributor on later Kinks albums.The group switched to MCA (US) and London (UK) records in late 1985, and began work on their next album, ''[[Think Visual]]''.The record was released in 1986, but only reached #81 on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' charts.Critics were lukewarm towards it, and it did not receive significant radio play.[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of Allmusic.comwould later comment that the album "represented an artistic dead end for the Kinks, as Ray Davies continued to crank out a series of competent, but undistinguished hard rockers."Dave Davies contributed two songs to ''Think Visual'', "Rock 'n' Roll Cities" and "When You were a Child".Rock 'n' Roll Cities was chosen in the US as the lead single for ''Think Visual'', and at its release it received a fair amount of play on mainstream rock radio.Davies and Mick Avory seemingly reconciled, as Davies asked him back to play drums on this track.<refname="Avory Discogs">[http://www.discogs.com/artist/Mick+AvoryMick Avory at www.discogs.com]</ref>The group recorded several more records for MCA, their last studio effort for them being 1989's ''[[UK Jive]]''.''UK Jive'' was received slightly better than ''Think Visual'', but it failed to enter into the Top 100.Dave Davies contributed the song "Dear Margaret" to the vinyl record - the cassette and CD of the album also contained two further Dave Davies songs, "Bright Lights" and "Perfect Strangers".The group left MCA and struggled to find a record label that would accept them.All four original members were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990, but this failed to revive their career.Eventually  The Kinks signed onto Columbia records, who released their final studio album together, ''[[Phobia (The Kinks album)|Phobia]]'', on 13 April 1993.Despite lots of publicity pushing and press attention, the record was unsuccessful, peaking at #166.Singles released failed to chart as well, mainly due to a record label mix-up that delivered the records to store a few weeks late.To ''Phobia'' Davies contributed the songs "It's Alright (Don't Think About It)" and "Close to the Wire".Columbia dropped the group in 1994, forcing them to retreat back to their old [[Konk Records]].The group released ''To The Bone'' on the small independent Grapevine records in 1994.The Kinks eventually disbanded in 1996.After the aborted solo effort, Davies' solo career was not revived until 1980, with the release of ''Dave Davies (AFL1-3603)'', which featured Davies performing all the instruments by himself.The album was named after its own serial number.''AFLI-3603'' peaked at #42 on the [[Billboard 200]].He went on to release ''Glamour'' (1981), which charted at #152.Davies brought in a back-up band to play with him on this record.''Chosen People'' was released in 1983, but failed to crack the Billboard 200.Davies released his first true solo studio album in twenty years, ''[[Bug (Dave Davies album)|Bug]]'', in 2002.''Fractured Mindz'' followed in January 2007, his first album of all new material in nearly five years.It was also his first new studio effort since his stroke in the summer of 2004 besides the track "God In my Brain" (which was recorded and released on the compilation album ''Kinked'' in January 2006).In February 2010, Davies released a DVD, ''Mystical Journey''.His planned US tour in support of the release was postponed per doctor's advice.<ref>[http://www.davedavies.com/new.htmDave Davies - What's New].Davedavies.com.Retrieved 5 March 2010</ref>

 
[[File:Gibson Flying V White.jpg|thumb|115px|left|AGibson Flying V]]
Davies has played a number of guitars over time, the most recognizable of which is his [[Gibson Flying V]].Davies bought it in 1965,<ref name PP1&dq Gibson Flying V by Zachary R. Fjestad, Larry Meiners] ISBN 1-886768-72-2, 9781886768727</ref>

Davies commented on his Flying V:



Davies has played many other guitars throughout his career.He has played several models of Gibson Les Pauls over time, including a "Goldtop" model with P90 pickups and a black '78 model.On his website he lists the following:

Other guitars that were used by Dave Davies during the 60's were amongst others:

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
He married Lisbet in 1967 and they divorced in 1990.From that marriage, Davies has four sons: Martin, Simon, Christian and Russell.His three children Daniel, Lana, and Eddie are from another relationship.A daughter Tracy was adopted when he was only 15.

Davies published an [[autobiography]], entitled ''Kink'', in 1996, in which he discussed his [[bisexuality]] at length, including a sexual relationship with [[Long John Baldry]].He also wrote of the tense professional relationship with his brother over the Kinks' 30-year career.On 30 June 2004, Davies suffered a stroke while exiting a lift at [[Broadcasting House]], where he had been promoting his then current album, ''[[Bug (Dave Davies album)|Bug]]''.He was taken to University College Hospital in Euston.Davies was released from the hospital on 27 August.Davies said in a 2006 interview:



By 2006, Davies had recovered enough to be able to walk, talk and play guitar.He is a friend of [[horror film|horror]] director [[John Carpenter]], and his work is featured on Carpenter's remake of ''[[Village of the Damned (1995 film)|Village of the Damned]]''.Carpenter also acted as godfather to Davies's son, Daniel, who plays in the [[hard rock]] bands [[Year Long Disaster]] and [[Karma to Burn]].#''Dave Davies (AFL1-3603)'' (1980)

  SENTENCES: '''Victor Lemonte Wooten''' (born September 11, 1964) is an [[United States|American]] [[Bass (guitar)|bass]] player, composer, author, and [[Record producer|producer]], and has been the recipient of five [[Grammy Award]]s.<refname="official bio/Wooten"></ref> 

Wooten has won the "Bass Player of the Year" award from ''[[Bass Player (magazine)|Bass Player]]'' magazine three times in a row, and was the first person to win the award more than once.<refname="official bio/Wooten"/> In addition to a solo career and collaborations with various artists, Wooten has been the bassist for [[Béla Fleck and the Flecktones]] since the group's formation in 1988.In 2008, Wooten joined [[Stanley Clarke]] and [[Marcus Miller]] to record an album.The trio of bassists, under the name [[SMV (band)|SMV]], released ''[[Thunder (SMV album)|Thunder]]'' in August 2008 and began a supporting tour the same month.<ref></ref>Wooten was also a judge for the 4th annual [[The Independent Music Awards|Independent Music Awards]] to support independent artists' careers.<ref>[http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/pastjudges.asp Independent Music Awards - Past Judges]</ref>

 
Born to Dorothy and Pete Wooten, Victor is the youngest of the five Wooten Brothers, the other four being Regi, [[Roy Wooten|Roy]], Rudy and Joseph Wooten, all of whom are musicians.At age two, brother Regi began to teach Victor to play bass, and by the age of six, Victor was playing in front of crowds with his brothers in their family band, The Wooten Brothers Band, and toured supporting [[Curtis Mayfield]], among others.<refname="official bio/Wooten"/> 
When his family moved east, they continued to hone their skills.His brothers began a residency at [[Busch Gardens]].When his brother Roy asked if Victor could learn the [[fiddle]] to play with them on quick notice, he complied, adding another instrument to his repertoire.[[Image:Victor Wooten.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Wootenplaying his [[Steinberger]] headless bass guitar at the ''[[Belly Up]]'' in 2006.]]Wooten is most often seen playing [[Fodera]] basses, of which he has a signature model.<ref>FoderaGuitars [http://www.fodera.com/vw_83_classic.html"Victor Wooten '83 Classic"], Fodera Guitars website, Retrieved on January 10, 2007.</ref>His most famous Fodera, a 1983 Monarch Deluxe which he refers to as "number 1", sports a [[Kahler Tremolo System]] model 2400 bridge.Fodera's "Yin Yang" basses (designed/created for Wooten) incorporate the [[Yin and yang|Yin Yang symbol]] - which Wooten often uses in various media - as a main focal point of the top's design and construction.It is often mistakenly thought that the Yin Yang symbol is painted onto the bass, but in reality, the symbol is created from two pieces of naturally finished wood (Ebony and Holly, for example), fitted together to create the Yin-Yang pattern.<ref>FoderaGuitars [http://www.fodera.com/vw_yy_4.html"Victor Wooten Yin-Yang 4 String"], Fodera Guitars website, Retrieved on January 10, 2007.</ref>Though Wooten's basses receive much attention, his most frequent and consistent response when asked by his fans about his equipment (or equipment in general) is that "the instrument doesn't make the music ... you do".He'll often go on to state that the most important features to look for in a bass are comfort and playability.During a question and answer session at a 1998 concert, Wooten stated that "If you take a newborn baby and put them on the instrument, they're going to get sounds out of it that I can't get out of it, so we're all the best."<ref>VictorWooten.(1999).''Victor Wooten Live at Bass Day 1998'' [VHS].Hudson Music.</ref>This philosophy seems closely related to Wooten's approach to music in general, which is that music is a language.According to Wooten, while speaking or listening, one doesn't focus on the mouth as it is forming words 

As well as playing electric bass (both fretted and fretless) and the double bass, Victor also played the [[cello]] in high school.He still plays cello occasionally with the Flecktones.This is the instrument to which he attributes his musical training.While Wooten considers himself to be a spiritual individual, he is not a part of any particular religion.He believes that, "God is too big for any one religion."<ref></ref>[[Category:1964 births]]

  SENTENCES: '''Damon Gough''' (stage name '''Badly Drawn Boy''') is an [[England|English]]<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2006/07/21/210706_bdb_uk_feature.shtmlBBC.co.uk]</ref> [[alternative music]] [[singer/songwriter]].He was  born on 2 October 1969, in [[Dunstable]], [[Bedfordshire]].He grew up in the [[Breightmet]] area of [[Bolton]], [[Lancashire]], [[England]].Damon Gough chose his stage name from the title character in the show ''Sam and his Magic Ball'', which he saw on [[television|TV]] at a party in [[Trafford]], [[Manchester]] in 1995.Before he thought of using this name he made some business cards, each one unique, with a printed picture of a drawing by his nephew and a small collage by Gough.This was then laminated and given out to friends and people at [[nightclub|clubs]] in [[Blackburn]] and Manchester.A chance meeting with [[Andy Votel]] at the Generation X bar in Manchester, where Gough's friends Scott Abraham and Damon Hayhurst were contributing to an exhibition by the Space Monkey Clothing Company and Votel was [[Disc jockey|DJing]], led to the foundation of [[Twisted Nerve Records]].Badly Drawn Boy's first 7-inch [[single (music)|single]], ''EP1'', was pressed the following year to critical acclaim, although only 500 copies were made.In 2002, [[Q magazine|''Q'' magazine]] named Badly Drawn Boy in their list of the "50 Bands to See Before You Die", although this was as part of a sub-list of "5 Bands That Could Go Either Way" on account of Gough's tendency to talk and tell stories for extended periods in concert rather than play songs.Gough's [[sound recording and reproduction|recording career]] began in September 1997 with the five track [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] release "EP1".This was distributed among friends and family members.With only 500 being pressed, the record is now considered something of a [[Holy grail]] for Badly Drawn Boy enthusiasts, with copies commanding as little as £100 on [[eBay]].In April 1998 Gough released his second EP, "EP2".This featured one track less than its predecessor but twice as many copies were pressed.The highlight track "I Love You All" was later transferred to a [[Musical box|music box]] which was released alongside the EP.The box plays eleven seconds of the song and is considered much rarer than the record itself due to its limited production.Gough's third EP, "EP3", was released in November 1998 on both [[Compact disc|CD]]  and vinyl formats, and was the first release in what would become a long-term partnership with [[XL Recordings]].In the same year he collaborated with [[Unkle]] for their first album [[Psyence Fiction]]."Road Movie" was released as a live recording with Gough's fellow Mancunians [[Doves (band)|Doves]].The B-side to the single was another track from the EP, "My Friend Cubilas".Music videos were recorded for both tracks.''It Came from the Ground'' was the next EP, released in March 1999 on CD and vinyl.The style of this recording focused on woodland environments, an aspect displayed in both the cover art and the title track's video.Also released during this period was the single "Whirlpool".An instrumental was released on vinyl in April 1999.Gough's last EP, ''Once Around the Block'', was released in August 1999 in two vinyl formats and one CD edition.The release is almost short enough to be considered a single.[[Image:Badly Drawn Boy SALT LAKE.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Gough playing a show in the [[Urban Lounge]], Salt Lake City, Utah.(March 2007)]]

Following the success of his early EPs, Gough's debut album, ''[[The Hour of Bewilderbeast]]'', was released in June 2000, accompanied by four singles (including a re-release of ''Once Around the Block'').The album was critically acclaimed and Badly Drawn Boy was successful in winning the 2000 [[Mercury Music Prize]], beating his contemporaries Doves to the £20,000 prize.The album sold well (300,000 copies) and is widely considered to be his defining work.After a short break, Gough returned to score the film adaptation of [[Nick Hornby]]'s novel ''[[About a Boy]]''.Impressed by his past work, the Weitz brothers asked Gough to score the film, a task which he undertook alone.Three singles from the album were released over the course of 2002.His third album, ''[[Have You Fed the Fish?]]'', introduced more guitars and an increasingly mainstream pop sound which was not welcomed by all critics.The album is a play on Gough's minor celebrity status and namechecks music icons such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[John Lennon]].Another three singles and a long American tour accompanied the album.After his long spell in America, Gough suffered from homesickness and decided to record his next album closer to home.Recorded at Moulin Rouge studios in [[Stockport]], [[Cheshire]], ''[[One Plus One Is One]]'' was a portrait of his personal life.Documenting a death of a close friend and the loss of a grandfather in the [[Battle of Normandy]], the album was released in 2004.It was not a great commercial success, and Gough decided to leave his contract with XL Recordings after only one single was released.He then signed to [[EMI]].Two years went by before ''[[Born in the U.K.]]'', which aims to explain Gough's experience of growing up in the [[United Kingdom]].The album was promoted with a small UK tour, profits from which were donated to [[Oxfam]], a charity which "offers the chance for thousands of people to use music to achieve something together, which is an idea that gets me excited," said Gough.<ref>[http://www.oxfam.org.uk/generationwhy/blog/2006/08/badly-drawn-boy-goes-on-tour-for-oxjam.htmlOxfam.org.uk]</ref>The album  "[[Is There Nothing We Could Do?]]", featuring 'music taken from and inspired by the motion picture ''[[The Fattest Man in Britain]]''' was released on his own BDB Records label in 2009.A seventh album, [[It's What I'm Thinking Pt.1 – Photographing Snowflakes]], the first of a planned trilogy of albums all to be released under the title ''It's What I'm Thinking'', was released in October 2010.<ref>http://www.exclaim.ca/Interviews/WebExclusive/badly_drawn_boy</ref>On 17 December 2010 while on stage at the Troubador in Los Angeles, Gough became unhappy with the quality of the sound acoustics at the venue and the audience, which lead to Gough swearing at some members of the audience.<ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/dec/20/badly-drawn-boy-onstage-meltdown</ref>[[Image:Badly drawn boy cardiff ts 2005.jpg|thumb|right|BadlyDrawn Boy performing at the [[Tsunami Relief Cardiff]] concert in January 2005]]

  SENTENCES: '''Han Bennink''' (born 17 April 1942) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[jazz]] [[drummer]] and [[percussionist]].On occasion his recordings have featured his playing on [[clarinet]], [[violin]], [[banjo]] and [[piano]].Though perhaps best known as one of the pivotal figures in early European [[free jazz]] and [[free improvisation]], Bennink has worked in essentially every school of jazz, and is described by critic Chris Kelsey<ref></ref> as "one of the unfortunately rare musicians whose abilities and interests span [jazz's] entire spectrum."Known for often injecting [[slapstick]] and [[absurdist humor]] into his performances, Bennink has had especially fruitful long-term partnerships with pianist [[Misha Mengelberg]] and saxophonist [[Peter Brötzmann]].Han is a brother of saxophonist [[Peter Bennink]].Bennink was born in [[Zaandam]], the son of a [[european classical music|classical]] percussionist.He played the drums and the [[clarinet]] during his teens.Through the 1960s he drummed with a number of American musicians visiting the Netherlands, including [[Dexter Gordon]], [[Sonny Rollins]] and [[Eric Dolphy]] (he can be heard on Dolphy's recording, ''Last Date'' (1964)).He subsequently became a central figure in the emerging European [[free improvisation]] scene.In 1963 he formed a quartet with pianist [[Misha Mengelberg]] and saxophonist [[Piet Noordijk]] which had a number of different bassists and which played at the 1966 [[Newport Jazz Festival]], and in 1967 he was a co-founder of the [[Instant Composers Pool]] with Mengelberg and [[Willem Breuker]], which sponsored Dutch avant garde performances.From the late 1960s he played in a trio with saxophonist [[Peter Brötzmann]] and Belgian pianist [[Fred Van Hove]], which became a duo after Van Hove's departure in 1976.Through much of the 1990s he played in Clusone 3 (also known as the Clusone Trio), a trio with  saxophonist and clarinetist [[Michael Moore (saxophonist and clarinetist)|Michael Moore]] and cellist [[Ernst Reijseger]].He has often played duos with Mengelberg and collaborated with him alongside other musicians.From the late 1980s through the early 2000s, Bennik collaborated closely with Dutch [[post-punk]] band [[The Ex (band)|The Ex]], appearing on their 1995 album ''[[Instant (album)|Instant]]'' and traveling and playing with them on their first tour to [[Ethiopia]].As well as playing with these long-standing groups, Bennink has performed and recorded solo (''Tempo Comodo'' (1982) being among his solo recordings) and played with many [[free improvisation]] and [[free jazz]] luminaries including [[Derek Bailey (guitarist)|Derek Bailey]], [[Conny Bauer]], [[Don Cherry (jazz)|Don Cherry]] and [[Alexander von Schlippenbach]], as well as more conventional jazz musicians like [[Lee Konitz]].[[Image:Benninkcheesetomatosandwich.jpg|thumb|HanBennink in Austin Texas April 2006]]

 

Bennink's style is wide-ranging, running from conventional jazz drumming to highly unconventional free improvisation, for which he often uses whatever [[found objects]] happen to be onstage (chairs, music stands, instrument cases), his own body (a favourite device involves putting a drumstick in his mouth and striking it with the other stick), and the entire performance space—the floor, doors, and walls.He makes frequent use of birdcalls and whatever else strikes his fancy (one particularly madcap performance in Toronto in the 1990s involved a deafening fire alarm bell placed on the floor).<references/>

Carter's songs were often noted for their poetic imagery, spirituality and storytelling while retaining connection to the country music of his southern American upbringing.Carter's memory has been kept alive by his many admirers, most notably his former partner.[[Tracy Grammer]] has continued to introduce previously unrecorded songs and recordings that the duo were working on prior to Carter's death.Dave Carter was born in [[Oxnard, California]].His father was a [[mathematician]] and a [[petroleum engineer]] and his mother was a [[science]] [[teacher]] and a [[Charismatic Christianity|charismatic Christian]].<refname   "mmatters" /> and worked as an [[embedded systems]] programmer for several years before taking up music full-time in the mid-1990s.Carter was greatly influenced by [[mythologist]] [[Joseph Campbell]], who visited his college, and American mystic [[Carlos Castaneda]].He was also influenced by the American landscape, [[Arthurian mythology]], the environment, and transcendental psychology.[[Image:CarterGrammer.jpg|thumb|left|DaveCarter and Tracy Grammer]]

Creager displays a unique fashion sense, including an obvious interest in [[corsets]] and [[Victorian dress reform|Victorian bloomers]], which she wears during her live performances.<ref>Meloraprofiled in "Something Previous Onstage."http://media.www.mcgilltribune.com/media/storage/paper234/news/2004/11/02/AE/Something.Previous.Onstage-789242.shtml</ref>She is also fascinated with historical events and people of the past, including the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] of 1911, [[Howard Hughes]], [[Rose Kennedy]], victims of [[Josef Mengele]], and others.She weaves these stories into the lyrics of her songs, as well as creating fictional stories of her own, sung in her wispy, tremulous vocals.The song "Mr.E.

  SENTENCES: '''John David Anderson''' (born December 13, 1954, in [[Orlando, Florida]])<ref name=CMT></ref> is an American [[country music]] artist with a successful career that has lasted more than 30 years.Starting in 1977 with the release of his first single, "I've Got a Feelin' (Somebody's Been Stealin')", Anderson has charted more than 40 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country [[music charts]], including five Number Ones: "[[Wild and Blue (song)|Wild and Blue]]", "[[Swingin']]", "[[Black Sheep (John Anderson song)|Black Sheep]]", "[[Straight Tequila Night]]", and "[[Money in the Bank (John Anderson song)|Money in the Bank]]".He has also recorded twenty-two studio albums on several labels.His newest album, ''Bigger Hands'', was released on June 2009, on the Country Crossing label.Raised in [[Apopka, Florida]], Anderson's first musical influences were not country artists, but [[rock and roll]] musicians such as [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[The Rolling Stones]].<refname Billboard></ref>

The club appearances finally paid off in [[1977]] when he signed his first recording contract with [[Warner Bros. Records]].He first hit the Billboard Country [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart in 1977 with the song "I’ve Got a Feelin’ (Somebody's Been Stealin')",<ref name CMT/>

A steady stream of singles through the late 1970s and early 1980s continued to build Anderson's name in the country genre.The song "I'm Just An Old Chunk Of Coal (But I'm Gonna Be A Diamond Someday)" from the 1981 album ''[[John Anderson 2]]'' netted Anderson a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for Best Male Country Vocal Performance.<ref></ref>The release of Anderson's fourth album, ''[[Wild & Blue]]'', in 1982 led to his breakthrough to mainstream country when the single "Swingin'" hit the airwaves early the next year.Co-written with long-time writing partner [[Lionel Delmore]], the song broke into the country charts and reached Number One by March, while at the same time crossing over to the Billboard Hot 100, reaching a peak of Number 43.<ref> </ref> The single became the biggest selling record in the history of Warner Bros. Records.<refname CMAAwards></ref>

Anderson's success with ''Wild & Blue'' carried on through several more albums, but none would match its chart numbers or sales, and only one single, "She Sure Got Away with My Heart," would crack the top 10 on the country charts.In 1986, Anderson and Warner Bros. parted ways.<refname="allmusic"/>

 

After leaving Warner Bros., Anderson signed with [[MCA Records]] and released two albums under that label, followed by one with [[Capitol Records]] in [[1990]].Chart success was minimal throughout those years.However, that turned around in 1991 when Anderson joined [[BNA Records]] and, working with legendary country producer [[James Stroud]], released the album ''[[Seminole Wind]]''.Powered by the title single, which rose to Number Two, and the Number One single "[[Straight Tequila Night]]", the album proved a resurgence for Anderson's career.<refname CMAAwards/>

The success of ''Seminole Wind'' brought a fresh life to Anderson's career, and he released a number of albums that charted well, producing several more singles that pushed to the upper levels of the country charts.The [[1993]] album ''[[Solid Ground (John Anderson album)|Solid Ground]]'' produced a Number One single, "[[Money in the Bank (John Anderson song)|Money in the Bank]]", which turned out to be the most recent chart-topper of Anderson's career.He recorded for BNA through [[1996]] before leaving the label.<refname=CMT/> In 1993, Anderson was awarded the [[Academy of Country Music]] Career Achievement award.<ref></ref>Anderson has recorded for several labels since his departure from BNA, with moderate chart success.<refname=Billboard/> A new album titled ''[[Bigger Hands]]'', a return to working with Stroud as producer, was released in June 2009.<ref></ref>Over his career, Anderson has collaborated with a number of different artists.He has worked with [[John Rich (musician)|John Rich]] of [[Big & Rich]] on his 2007 album ''[[Easy Money (album)|Easy Money]]'',<ref name=easymoney></ref> and co-wrote Rich's 2009 single "[[Shuttin' Detroit Down]]"<ref></ref> He has been named an honorary member of the [[MuzikMafia]], of which Rich is also a member.<ref></ref>Anderson lives in [[Smithville, Tennessee]], his home for more than 30 years.<refname=easymoney/>

  SENTENCES: '''Hank Brian Marvin''' (born 28 October 1941) is an English guitarist, best known as the [[lead guitarist]] for [[The Shadows]].The group, which primarily performed [[instrumental]]s, was formed as a backing band for vocalist [[Cliff Richard]].<refname="h2g2" /> Marvin has a distinctive guitar sound and appearance, primarily using a clean sound with very distinctive [[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]] and [[vibrato]] giving a dreamy effect.<ref></ref>He was born '''Brian Robson Rankin''' on 28 October 1941 in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], England.As a child, he played the [[banjo]] and [[piano]].After he heard one of [[Buddy Holly]]'s songs, he decided to also learn the guitar.<refname="h2g2">[http://h2g2.com/dna/h2g2/A30466208 Hank Marvin - Guitar God]</ref>

He chose the name '''Hank Marvin''' while launching his music career.The name is an amalgamation of his childhood nickname of Hank, which he used to differentiate himself from a number of friends also named Brian, and [[Marvin Rainwater]], a [[country and western]] singer.When Marvin was 16, he travelled with his Rutherford [[Grammar School]] friend [[Bruce Welch]] to London, where he met Johnny Foster, Cliff Richard's manager, at [[The 2i's Coffee Bar]] in [[Soho]].Foster was looking for a guitarist for Richard's upcoming tour of the U.K., and Marvin agreed to join as long as there was also a place for Welch.Foster had actually been looking for guitarist [[Tony Sheridan]] at the Two 2i's, but by chance he encountered Marvin.Marvin and Welch joined [[The Shadows|The Drifters]], as Cliff Richard's group was then known, beginning their careers as professional guitar players.Marvin met Cliff Richard for the first time at a nearby Soho tailor's shop, where Richard was having a fitting for a pink stage jacket.They had their first rehearsal with him at his parents' home in [[Cheshunt]].Marvin lived in the hills above [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Western Australia]] from 1986 but has since relocated to a luxury apartment in East Perth.He is a committed [[Jehovah's Witness]].<ref>[http://top40-charts.com/videos/play.php?vid=0e_XUFWEsaE Hank Marvin discusses his faith]</ref> When not relaxing at his home in Perth, Marvin runs a successful recording studio: Nivram studios (part of Sh-Boom studios in Tiverton street owned by Trevor Spencer and Gary Taylor) where he is happy(?) to receive correspondence from die-hard Shadows fans.In the UK, his name is often humourously recognised as [[cockney rhyming slang]] for the word "starving".<ref>http://www.londonslang.com/db/h/</ref>[[File:NEW 8.jpg|thumb|Hank Marvin and Jean-Pierre Danel, 2007]]

 
Marvin played and owned the first [[Fender Stratocaster]] in the UK, serial number 34346, finished in Fiesta Red, with gold hardware.This guitar, with its [[tremolo arm]], contributed to the Shadows' sound.The guitar was imported from America by Cliff Richard.Marvin almost immediately customised this guitar's red paintwork with three simple cheap aluminium sticky back transfers or decals of his initials viz: "H", "B", "M", bought from a local hardware shop in London and simply stuck them on top.Marvin's original sound was achieved with this Stratocaster, a [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]] amplifier (initially an AC15 and later on an AC30 models) and a tape echo machine [[Meazzi]] [[Echomatic]] that was shown to him by [[Joe Brown (singer)|Joe Brown]].He later used a Vox-badged Meazzi, then a [[Binson]] [[Echorec]] (Drum) Echo Machine and finally another tape-loop machine, the [[Roland]] [[301 Space Echo]], before moving on to electronic units like the [[Behringer]] Delay Machine.In 1959, Marvin and Richard searched through a Fender catalogue to find the model of guitar played by [[James Burton]], [[Ricky Nelson]]'s lead guitarist.They assumed that Burton's guitar was a Stratocaster, because the most expensive guitar in the brochure was a gold-plated example with a red body and a one-piece Maple neck.Burton, however, played the Telecaster, and the Stratocaster was a relatively new model, available only to special order.Richard made the arrangements and the chosen guitar was imported specially for Marvin, who used it between 1959 and 1961.It remained Richard's property and was returned to him when [[Jennings Musical Instruments]] outfitted the whole group with matching Fiesta Red Fender guitars, which featured necks with rosewood fingerboards.Marvin continued borrowing the original Stratocaster for recording.In 1970 to facilitate a new Shadows' type guitar sound, Marvin and bandmate John Farrar bought electric and two Martin acoustic guitars.Farrar purchased a Fender thinline Telecaster with a Bigsby tremolo arm whereas Marvin purchased a new Fender Stratocaster guitar with a sunburst finish with non-Fender custom pickups and a large headstock.This Fender Stratocaster guitar was subsequently resprayed in a Black-gloss finish and was used by Marvin during the 1970s and early 1980s Shadows' studio albums and concerts.By the mid-80s Marvin reverted to a third Red Fiesta Fender Stratocaster guitar for studio and concerts.Marvin subsequently gave the Black Fender Stratocaster to his son [[Ben Marvin]] who had it resprayed back to its original sunburst finish.<!--- {ref:} http://www.manchesterbeat.com/shops/barratts/barratts.php--->

[[File:Cliff Richard and the Shadows 2009.jpg|thumb|left|CliffRichard and the Shadows 2009]]
In 2009, to mark the The Shadows 50th anniversary and "34346", the original Stratocaster is being reproduced in detail by Fender's Custom Shop in California.Built by Fender Master Luthier Greg Fessler, the run is limited to 50 pieces and has been produced within Fender's Dealer Select program.Commissioned by [http://www.oasismusic.co.ukOasis Musical Instruments] (a UK guitar dealer run by "Shads" fan Howard Gillespie) The guitar is a faithful reproduction of the original, down to the mythical colour which Marvin called "Flamingo Pink".This colour is also referred to by Dire Straits Guitarist Mark Knopfler in Alan Yentob's BBC TV series.Fender has always denied the existence of that colour, and remained true to form by naming the colour of the reproduction "U K Custom Red".Exclusive to this guitar the colour is not available to order despite being given a colour code by the Custom Shop.Each one of the limited edition includes a certificate of authenticity from Fender, stating that the instrument is a reproduction of "The first Stratocaster to be imported into the UK" signed by the Master Builder, there is also a signed certificate of endorsement from Hank Marvin and Bruce Welch.In the early 1960s, Jennings named a range of guitar accessories after Marvin.The accessories included [[plectrum]], a guitar strap, and a [[Bigsby vibrato tailpiece|Bigsby]]-styled [[tremolo]] unit.They used the Hank Marvin signature tremolo unit on several of their own Vox guitars.Marvin also worked with Jim Burns, head of the [[Burns London]] guitar company, to develop his own signature model, known as the "Burns Marvin".The "Marvin" appeared in 1964 and a 12-string version called the "Double Six" appeared a little earlier.In 1967, the Burns London company was taken over by the American piano-maker, [[Baldwin Piano Company]], and partly as a result of the takeover, the fewer-than-400 original Burns-made Marvins are now highly sought after.The revived Burns company made a limited reissue of 2004 signature Marvin guitars with a certificate of authenticity, signed by Marvin.Those instruments were promoted on the Shadows' 2004 Final Tour.Marvin's original Burns guitars had been stolen in 1972 and never appeared again.Marvin influenced many guitarists, including [[Pete Townshend]], [[Mark Knopfler]] and [[John Fogerty]].Although neither Marvin nor the Shadows were ever well known in the United States, despite several appearances on the [[Ed Sullivan Show]], Marvin is listed by [[Frank Zappa]] as an influence on the first [[Mothers of Invention]] album.[[Afrikaa Bambaataa]] cited the group's first UK number one single "[[Apache (single)|Apache]]" as a big influence, though it is likely that Bambaattaa was referring to the cover of "Apache" by The Incredible Bongo Band, which was popular among early hip hop DJs, due to the extended bongo break.In Canada, Cliff Richard and the Shadows met with success, especially 1961-1965 when they enjoyed several top 10 hits.Canadian guitarists [[Randy Bachman]] and [[Neil Young]] have credited Marvin's guitar work as influential.[[Carlos Santana]]'s nickname in his formative years was ''Apache'' because it was one of the earliest pieces he learned to play.As well as playing with The Shadows, Hank Marvin has had a successful solo career.He has been willing to experiment with styles and material, doing some purely instrumental albums, some with only vocals (e.g."All Alone With Friends"), one with only acoustic guitars and one with a guitar orchestra ("The Hank Marvin Guitar Syndicate").In 1970, Marvin and Welch formed [[Marvin, Welch & Farrar]], a vocal harmony trio which failed to appeal to many Shadows fans or to contemporary music fans.They reverted to being The Shadows in 1973, for the ''[[Rockin' with Curly Leads]]'' album.As a writer, Marvin was solely responsible for "Driftin'", "Geronimo", "Spider Juice" (his daughter's name for orange juice), "I want you to Want Me" for The Shadows, and "The Day I Met Marie".As co-writer with Bruce Welch, Brian Bennett, and John Rostill, he wrote other hits, mainly for Cliff Richard, including "I Could Easily Fall in Love with You" and "In the Country".In 1988, Marvin collaborated with French keyboardist and composer [[Jean Michel Jarre]] on the track "London Kid", which appeared on Jarre's "Revolutions" album and taking a guest role in the Frenchman's giant [[Destination Docklands]] concert at the [[Royal Victoria Dock]].Jarre stated that the Shadows' success had a huge influence on him and his decision to devote the majority of his career to instrumental music.In 1992, Duane Eddy guested on Marvin's album ''Into the Light'' on the track "[[Pipeline (instrumental)|Pipeline]]".Marvin and the Shadows reformed for a 2004 Final Tour, which was so successful that a 2005 European tour was also organised.Marvin dueted twice with French award-winning guitarist [[Jean-Pierre Danel]], on his 2007 and 2010 albums.Marvin also participated to one of his dvds and wrote the foreword for Danel's book about the [[Fender Stratocaster]].While his Shadows colleagues Bruce Welch and [[Brian Bennett (musician)|Brian Bennett]] accepted the honour of an Officer of the Order of the British Empire ([[Order of the British Empire|OBE]]) in the 2004 [[British honours system|Queen's Birthday Honours]] List for services to music, Marvin declined, citing "personal reasons".<refname="bbc news">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3799147.stmActor Hurt leads Queen's honours], &mdash

Lindley is particularly well-known for his work as a session musician, especially for rock musicians.Aside from his own solo and band efforts, it is difficult to list all the musicians who have collaborated with Lindley.He has contributed to recordings and live performances by [[Jackson Browne]], [[Warren Zevon]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Curtis Mayfield]], [[James Taylor]], [[David Crosby]], [[Graham Nash]], [[Terry Reid]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Rod Stewart]].He has also collaborated with fellow guitarists [[Ry Cooder]] and [[Henry Kaiser (musician)|Henry Kaiser]].Artist [[Ben Harper]] has credited Lindley's distinctive [[slide guitar]] style as a major influence on his own playing and in 2006 Lindley sat in on Harper's album ''[[Both Sides of the Gun]]''.He is known in the guitar community for his use of "cheap" instruments sold at [[Sears, Roebuck and Co.|Sears department stores]] and intended for amateurs.He uses these for the unique sound they produce, especially with a slide.In the early 1990s, he toured and recorded with [[Hani Naser]] adding [[percussion|percussive instrument]]s to his solo performances, and his instrumental repertoire which he uses in his session work.In recent years, Lindley has also toured extensively and recorded with [[reggae]] [[percussionist]] [[Wally Ingram]].It is his touring around the world that has exposed him to part of his array of instruments that appear exotic to many Western audiences.While Lindley is not known as a vocalist, his voice has been widely heard in the version of [[Stay (Maurice Williams song)|''Stay'']] performed by [[Jackson Browne]].Browne's version is a continuation of ''The Load Out'', and its refrain is sung in progressively higher vocal ranges.The refrain of  "Oh won't you stay, just a little bit longer" is sung first by Browne, then by [[Rosemary Butler]], then by Lindley in falsetto.<ref></ref>Lindley joined Jackson Browne for a tour of Spain in 2006."Love is Strange," a 2-CD set of recordings from that tour, was released May 11, 2010, with Browne and Lindley touring together starting in June.<ref>http://jacksonbrowne.com/news/2010/03/04/jackson-browne-david-lindley-tour-heads-u-s-and-europe-summer</ref>[[File:David lindley 31101981 01 300.jpg|thumb|Lindley in [[Oslo]], 1981]]
Lindley has an extremely large collection of rare, and to the majority of Westerners, unusual looking and sounding instruments.There is a large and detailed display of quite a few rare guitars, as well as instruments that originate from the Middle East and other parts of the world.Lindley has listed and categorized many of them on his website<ref name "AG Magazine1"/>

  SENTENCES: '''Elmer Snowden''' (October 9, 1900 – May 14, 1973) was a [[banjo]] player of the jazz age.He also played guitar and, in the early stages of his career, all the reed instruments.He contributed greatly to jazz in its early days as both a player and a bandleader, and is responsible for launching the careers of many top musicians.However, Snowden himself has been largely overlooked in jazz history.Born in [[Baltimore]], Snowden is remembered today mainly as the original leader of the [[Washingtonians]], a group he brought to New York City from the capital in 1923.Unable to get a booking, Snowden sent for [[Duke Ellington]], who was with the group when it recorded three test sides for Victor that remain unissued and are, presumably, lost.Ellington eventually took over leadership of the band,<ref>[http://books.google.es/books?id9 ''The Rough Guide to Jazz'' Carr, Ian 

Very active in the 1920s as an agent and musician, Snowden at one time had five bands playing under his name in New York, one of which was led by pianist [[Cliff Jackson]].Unfortunately, most of his bands were not recorded, but a Snowden band that included Eldridge, [[Al Sears]], [[Dicky Wells]] and [[Sid Catlett]] appeared in a 1932 film, ''Smash Your Baggage''.Snowden also made numerous appearances as a sideman on almost every [[New York]] label from 1923 on.Unfortunately, he rarely received credit, except for two sides with [[Bessie Smith]] in 1925, and six sides with the [[Sepia Serenaders]] in 1934.Though Snowden continued to be musically active throughout his life, after the mid 1930s he lived in relative obscurity in New York.He continued to play throughout the 30s, 40s and 50s, but was far from the limelight.After a dispute with the musicians union in New York, he moved to [[Philadelphia]] where he taught music, counting among his pupils pianist [[Ray Bryant]], his brother, bassist Tommy Bryant, and saxophonist [[Sahib Shihab]] (Edmond Gregory).Snowden was working as a parking lot attendant in 1959 when [[Chris Albertson]], then a Philadelphia disc jockey, came across him.In 1960, Albertson brought Snowden and singer-guitarist [[Lonnie Johnson]] together for two [[Prestige]] albums, assembled a quartet that included [[Cliff Jackson]] for a [[Riverside Records|Riverside]] session, ''Harlem Banjo,'' and, in 1961, a sextet session with [[Roy Eldridge]], [[Bud Freeman]], [[Jo Jones]], and Ray and Tommy Bryant—it was released on the Fontana and Black Lion labels.In 1963, his career boosted, Snowden appeared at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]].He toured Europe in 1967 with the Newport Guitar Workshop.He moved to [[California]] to teach at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and played with [[Turk Murphy]].In 1969, Snowden moved back to Philadelphia, where he died on May 14, 1973.[[Category:Jazz banjoists]]

  SENTENCES: '''The Corries''' were a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[folk group]] that emerged from the Scottish [[roots revival|folk revival]] of the early 1960s.Although the group was a trio in the early days, it was as the partnership of [[Roy Williamson]] and [[Ronnie Browne]] that it is best known.Roy Williamson was born in 1936 in [[Edinburgh]], [[Lothian]].His mother played the piano.At school he learned to play the [[recorder]] by ear, pretending to read [[music]].The teacher found out and banned him from music lessons.He went to [[Wester Elchies School]], then [[Aberlour]] House and [[Gordonstoun]] in [[Moray]].He taught seamanship and navigation at [[Burghead]] before going to [[Edinburgh College of Art]].It was there that he met Ronnie Browne in 1955.The partnership lasted over thirty years.Williamson teamed up with [[Bill Smith (folk musician)|Bill Smith]] (born William Smith, in 1936, in Edinburgh) and [[Ron Cruikshank]] to form the "Corrie Folk Trio" in 1962.Their first performance was in the [[Waverley Bar]] in St Mary's Street, Edinburgh.After a few weeks Cruikshank left.They had already accepted an engagement at the [[Edinburgh Festival]] so Williamson suggested that Ronnie Browne should be brought in to make up numbers.They also added female [[Ireland|Irish]] singer [[Paddie Bell]] to become the "Corrie Folk Trio and Paddie Bell".The audience was only eight people for the debut of this line-up but by the end of the festival it was house full at every performance.A [[Cirque|corrie]] is a deep bowl in the high Scottish mountains familiar to lovers of the Highlands.They chose it to evoke the Scottish landscape.Within a year they appeared on television.Williamson and Browne were art teachers, Smith was an architect and Bell was a secretary.In 1964 they topped the bill at a show with [[The Dubliners]] at the [[Usher Hall]] in Edinburgh.The [[BBC]] began a television series set in a folk club.The resident group at the "Hoot'nanny Show" was the Corrie Folk Trio.This meant they became full-time professionals.Within two years Paddie Bell and Bill Smith left.Williamson was a talented multi-instrumentalist and Browne was the singer.They cancelled all engagements for a few months to practise intensively.Under the new name, "The Corries", they performed at the Jubilee Arms Hotel in [[Cortachy]], [[Angus]].The response encouraged them to continue.Another BBC series "[[The White Heather Club]]" began in 1958.It featured [[Andy Stewart (musician)|Andy Stewart]], [[Jimmy Shand]] and his Band, [[Robin Hall]] and [[Jimmie MacGregor]], and the Corries.While the rest of the show was set in a studio, the Corries were filmed in location: [[Sea shanties|sea songs]] were sung in a harbour, "[[Braes o' Killiecrankie]]" was sung at the Pass of [[Killiecrankie]], and so on.They were effectively pioneers of the music video.''Main Article'': [[Combolin]]

Williamson was a skilled woodworker.In the summer of 1969 he invented the 'combolins', two complementary instruments which combined several into a single instrument.One combined a [[mandolin]] and a [[guitar]] (along with four bass strings operated with slides), the other combined guitar and the Spanish [[bandurria]], the latter being an instrument Williamson had played since the early days of the Corrie Folk Trio.Originally conceived as a way to combine several of the many instruments they carried around on tour - the Corries' long row of chairs behind them on stage bearing instruments is legendary - the combolins in fact became an additional two instruments for the tour van.Most often, Browne played the guitar/mandolin instrument with bass strings, and Williamson the other, which also had 13 sympathetic strings designed to resonate like the Indian [[sitar]].The wood for the instruments was obtained from antique hardwood furniture as well as premium grade Tyrolean spruce, and featured Williamson's artistic embellishments in silver and mother of pearl.The Corries' next album, ''Strings and Things'' (1970), was specifically designed to showcase the new instruments and featured detailed descriptions of them on the rear sleeve.Many consider it to be their best album.On stage, when the combolins were played, the Corries would swap their seating position around from the conventional Williamson to Browne's right.Usually the combolins were played to accompany long ballads such as ''The Silkie of Sule Skerry'' and ''[[The Gartan Mother's Lullaby]]'', as well as a number of the compositions of [[Peebles]] baker George Weir, including ''Lord Yester'' and ''Weep ye Weel by Atholl''.The immense strain on the instruments caused by the multitude of strings meant they needed regular maintenance later in their life, and one of Williamson's best friends, instrument repairer David Sinton, maintained them.After Williamson's death, Sinton was bequeathed the two combolins.He has since issued a CD of tunes played on them, ''Caledonian Sunset'', although it took many years to perfect the playing of these complex instruments, as well as deal with the undoubted emotional difficulty in playing them.The early 1970s saw the Corries reach their peak of popularity.They had several albums in the top 50 album charts in Scotland, and released a single: - "[[Flower of Scotland]]" (1974).It includes [[Flower of Scotland]] and [[Roses of Prince Charlie]].It was quickly adopted by world lightweight boxing champion [[Ken Buchanan]] whose fans sang it on his entering the ring.It was then taken up by supporters of [[rugby football]] as the unofficial [[national anthem]] and is still used at Scotland's rugby internationals.It has also been adopted as the national anthem at international [[Association football|football]] matches.The Corries' concerts frequently had the audience joining in spontaneously in the chorus of songs.The duo became closely identified with [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] songs, celebrating the final years of clan loyalty and military courage.In 1977, one of their best albums ''Peat Fire Flame'' was released.This saw a move towards love songs and celebrations of the landscape.As a young man, Roy Williamson played rugby for [[Edinburgh Wanderers]].However, he suffered from [[asthma]] and before a series of concerts he would deliberately cease treatment in order to provoke attacks and gain temporary immunity.During the Corries' 1989 tour, Williamson's health went into decline and he was diagnosed with a brain tumour.He spent his last years living in [[Forres]], close to where he spent his school years.He died on 12 August 1990.Ronnie Browne continued recording and moved into acting, as well as expanding his career as a noted painter, including commissions for the 1990 Scottish Rugby Union team's Grand Slam victory.He toured as a soloist for a few years after Williamson's death, and even released a solo album, but never reached the same level of success that he achieved as part of the duo.He has now retired from performing.Paddie Bell made some solo albums following her departure from the trio, most notably with Irish musicians Finbar and Eddie Furey, but withdrew from the folk scene followed by a period of dependency on alcohol and anti-depressant medication.In the 1990s Bell, with the help of several friends and fans on the folk scene in Edinburgh, revived her singing career with a couple of new recordings and became something of a celebrity again.She died in 2005 aged 74.In December 2007, The Corries were inducted into the Scottish Traditional Music Hall of Fame at the Scottish Trad Music Awards in [[Fort William, Scotland|Fort William]], promoted by concertina virtuoso [[Simon Thoumire]]'s Hands Up for Trad organisation.Many of the Corries recordings have now been reissued on CD by Moidart Music, a company set up originally to release Williamson's posthumous [[Long Journey South]] solo album.The recordings are now overseen by Browne's son Gavin, who runs the official Corries website, along with original recording engineer Allan Spence and David Sinton.[[Category:Scottish folk musicians]]

When we put the band [[Iggy and the Stooges]] back together, I asked him if he wanted to play with us, and he said, 'Sure,' and the rest is history."Williamson went on to say that he didn’t even play much on Iggy Pop’s ''[[New Values]]'' album: "Actually, I only played guitar on a couple of things.Scott played almost all the guitar.He’s a very talented guy.He’s a very good guitar player and a very good keyboard guy.He’s just a very good musician."In 1982 Thurston joined The Motels and played on their 1983 album ''Little Robbers''.Thurston joined [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]] for their ''[[Touring The Great Wide Open]]'' tour in 1991, which turned into a permanent spot for Thurston in the band’s lineup.Thurston plays acoustic and electric guitar and bass guitar 

[[Tom Petty]] said, "I was trying to get him out of the corner over there, because he always saw himself as a sideman—'I’m a Sidebreaker'—and he tried to stay over to the side.But we love him, he sings great with me, and we want him out there with us.He’s a good buffer between the rest of us.When we’re fighting or have some cliqueishness, he’s good at getting in there and saying, 'Let’s look at it this way,' because Duckhead, as we call him, is neutral.He doesn’t come from [[Florida]], wasn’t there when this or that happened.”<ref>''RollingStone'', July 8–22, 1999</ref>

  SENTENCES: '''John William Lowery''' (born July 31, 1971), best known by the stage name '''John 5''', is an [[United States|American]] [[guitarist]].His stage name was bestowed on him in 1998 when he left [[David Lee Roth]] and joined the industrial metal group [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] as their guitarist, taking over from [[Zim Zum]].Still going by the name "John 5," Lowery is currently the guitarist for [[Rob Zombie]].He is also a solo artist having recorded six guitar albums: ''[[Vertigo (John 5 album)|Vertigo]]'' (2004), ''[[Songs for Sanity]]'' (2005), ''[[The Devil Knows My Name]]'' (2007), ''[[Requiem (John 5 album)|Requiem]]'' (2008), ''[[The Art of Malice]]'' (2010) and ''Gold Told Me to'' (2011), as well as a remix album, ''[[Remixploitation]]'' (2009).He also works as a staff writer for [[Chrysalis Records]], working with artists such as Matt Ball, [[Avril Lavigne]], [[Rob Halford]], [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]], [[Meat Loaf]], [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Slash (musician)|Slash]], [[FeFe Dobson]] and has written and recorded with [[southern rock]] band [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]].Lowery first started playing guitar at the age of seven after watching [[Buck Owens]] and [[Roy Clark]]'s television show ''[[Hee Haw]]'' with his dad.His parents supported his playing as long as it did not interfere with his education.They also accompanied him at the adult bars he would play during the evening.<ref></ref>Lowery started his career as a session guitarist having moved to [[Los Angeles]] from Michigan at the age of 17.His first band in L.A. was Alligator Soup, which led to an important meeting with [[Rudy Sarzo]] from [[Whitesnake]], that would give him his first real bit of exposure.This also saw him meeting producer Bob Marlette, who has worked with, among others, [[Tracy Chapman]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Rob Halford]] and [[Black Sabbath]].Lowery began working on numerous projects with Marlette including TV show soundtracks, movie soundtracks including ''[[Speed 2: Cruise Control]]'', and commercials and infomercials.This in turn saw Lowery being picked to play with [[Lita Ford]], opening up for [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]].He started another long time friendship with the various Kiss members, including a close friendship with [[Paul Stanley]] which in 2006 he repaid by guesting on Stanley's ''[[Live to Win]]'' album.Lowery's next role saw him working with [[Randy Castillo]], in a short-lived project called Red Square Black.They produced a self titled EP, but the band disbanded when Lowery was picked from 2000 guitarists to play with [[k.d lang]] on tour.In 1996 Lowery went for his first audition with [[Marilyn Manson]] but narrowly missed out (he was late to the auditions) and the guitarist role at that time was taken by Mike (Timothy) Linton, who became known as [[Zim Zum]].Instead, Lowery teamed up with ex-[[Judas Priest]] frontman [[Rob Halford]], along with Sid Riggs (drums) James Wooley (keyboards),and Ray Riendeau (bass) to work on an industrial metal inspired album, under the band name of 2wo (Two).The subsequent album (''[[Voyeurs (album)|Voyeurs]]'') was remixed by [[Trent Reznor]] ([[Nine Inch Nails]]) and was released on Reznor's [[Nothing Records]] label, under the parent company, [[Interscope Records]] (Universal).The album itself was not a commercial hit but did produce one video, made by gay porn director [[Chi Chi Larue]] for the first single "I'm a Pig".<ref></ref>It featured some s&m scenes and so was not widely broadcast but was not banned as has been previously rumored.The band embarked on a world tour, and were part of the [[Ozzfest]] line-up but the tour was pulled and 2wo disbanded.Arguably, Lowery's first truly "big break" came when he was selected by former [[Van Halen]] frontman [[David Lee Roth]] to play lead guitar on the critically well-received 1998 release ''[[DLR Band]]''.As had occurred, historically, when Roth chose a new lead guitarist - in light of Roth's lead guitar lineage: from [[Eddie Van Halen]] to [[Steve Vai]] to [[Jason Becker]] to [[Steve Hunter]] and others - Lowery quickly gained public recognition for his virtuosic abilities, as well for the "heart" in his playing.Regarding how he came to meet Roth, in Guitarist Magazine, Lowery relates that, "when I was little, my dream was to play with David Lee Roth.One day I was sitting at my friend's house and...I wonder[ed] what... Roth is doing now.[In 1997, Roth had just been let go from Van Halen for a second time in favor of [[Gary Cherone]], and also penned a tongue-in-cheek memoir.].I'm gonna call up his manager and see if he needs any songs."<ref name="Guitarist Magazine"></ref>

Lowery submitted six tracks that he had written to Roth's management.Having been a longtime fan of David Lee Roth's, both in Van Halen and as a solo artist, Lowery believed that he knew exactly what Roth would like.On hearing Lowery's songs, Roth was very impressed, and subsequently asked for Lowery to submit several more songs.At the time, Roth was choosing between Lowery and Mike Hartman as to who would play lead guitar.Hartman would ultimately play bass on the album under the moniker, "B'urbon Bob." Tragically, Hartman would die a short time later.Impressed by Lowery's prodigious skill, Roth scheduled a meeting and then - without haste - scheduled a recording session that lasted for a mere two weeks and resulted in the fourteen track DLR Band album."I remember before we started, he [David Lee Roth] said, 'If you can't do it in two takes, you can't do it.'"<refname="Guitarist Magazine"/> Roth's philosophy brought out the best in Lowery, whose guitar sounds particularly raw and excitable on the DLR Band album, (as opposed to on later albums with other artists, which feature heavy production and sometimes distort Lowery's sound.)In 2003, while still lead guitarist for [[Marilyn Manson]], David Lee Roth invited Lowery (then called John 5) to write and record the single non-cover song for Roth's 2003 album ''[[Diamond Dave]]''.The resulting track, "Thug Pop", typifies Lowery's work with Roth: both raw and frenzied, but with bursts of emotion and subtlety that show a duo with great chemistry.After the recording of ''[[Mechanical Animals]]'', [[Marilyn Manson]] was again looking for a guitarist to replace Zim Zum who had been dismissed from the band during the recording process.Again John went to try out for the band.Following a tour with [[Rob Halford]] in Europe, John received a call from Manson's manager asking if he would like to meet Manson for lunch.At the meeting Manson asked John to join the band.<ref></ref>Taking the moniker, John 5, he signed on for the Mechanical Animals tour and to work on the next album.Lowery's first live performance for Marilyn Manson came on the [[MTV Video Music Awards]].During the opening bars of the "[[The Beautiful People (Marilyn Manson song)|The Beautiful People]]" at the 2003 [[Rock Am Ring]] festival Manson was prancing across the stage when he hit Lowery's guitar and chest with his boot.Lowery was outraged and threw his guitar while screaming at Manson, which led to much speculation.According to Lowery, the Grotesk Burlesk tour had been a high-pressure endeavour, and just weeks before he had suffered losses of very close family members.Lowery later commented on his behavior, calling it unprofessional and stating that there is no bad blood between himself and Manson.During this time period Lowery also worked on a band called, Plague, with Jason Lowetz as the frontman.The album was produced with Bob Marlette but never made it out of the studio.Lowetz was considered for the job as frontman for Velvet Revolver before Scott Weiland took it on.In 2004 Lowery and Manson parted company.Confusion was rife as certain press reported that he had been dumped unceremoniously from the band, but in reality the two came to a mutual agreement that they wanted to go their separate ways.“Whatactually happened was, at the end of the tour, we were just on different roads.It was completely amicable.He just wanted to write with other members of the band, and I wanted to do other things."<ref></ref>While working with Manson, Lowery has stated he did not do drugs, and he does not drink.In 2005 Lowery formed the band Loser.Recruiting vocalist [[Joe Grah]], [[Charles Lee (musician)|Charles Lee]] on bass and [[Glendon Crain]] on drums, they began working on their debut album ''Just Like You''.The band was also partly co-founded by friend and producer Bob Marlette.Vocalist Joe Grah already had a significant amount of success in his home state of Texas, with the band Jibe.Marlette recommended Grah to Lowery and so Lowery hopped on a plane to Texas to see the band play.Grah flew back to LA and was hired on the spot.The name Loser came about as an affirmation to Lowery's past:
“I was from Grosse Pointe, Michigan, which is kind of an upper-class area, and I was always that rock kid," John explained."I started playing guitar at age 7. I always had a rock shirt on, and I had that tattoo early on.I looked like a loser because everyone around me was wearing [[Polo Ralph Lauren|Polo]] and [[Brooks Brothers]].But now if you go into a club wearing Polo, you're called a loser.So I think everyone can relate to that name, and the album title, Just Like You, sums it up."<ref></ref>

The band had initial success not long after signing with [[Island Records]], when the track "Disposable Sunshine" became part of the ''[[Fantastic Four (film)|Fantastic Four]]'' soundtrack.During this time, during the recording of the soundtrack, Crain briefly left the band and was replaced by drummer [[Elias Andra]], a friend of Lee's.Andra had some success himself with the band [[Psycho Plague]], his own creation, an industrial metal band, which toured as a headline act, with [[Linkin Park]] as an opening act at the time.However, Andra soon left after promotional shots had been taken, and Crain returned.Andra went on to become the drummer for [[Julien-K]].At the same time Lowery was also working for Rob Zombie and a working conflict occurred.As Zombie was also touring, Lowery tried to find a live replacement for him while Loser were touring on conflicting dates.However, even with promo material for the debut album out and a release date in the bag, Island Record did not like the idea of Loser without John and so dropped the band from the label."Being the founding member of Loser, my decision to leave was not an easy one", said John 5 in a press release."I've been juggling two careers both with Loser and Rob Zombie for over one year now.I found it impossible to be in two places at once."<ref></ref>The album has been put on the backburner and no word on a release date has ever been issued.The official Loser [[Myspace]] page has tracks available for download (working on November 23, 2007).<ref></ref>While Lowery was working on radio rock band Loser, he also began to work with cult rock artist and movie director, Rob Zombie.Meeting at the [[Camp Freddy]] benefit gig, John and Zombie hit off immediately and Rob asked John to play for him for Ozzfest 2005."I'm totally ecstatic about having the opportunity to play with Rob on Ozzfest!He has been one of my favourite artists for the longest time.I had the opportunity to play with him a few weeks back, and never thought that I would have the chance to share the stage with him playing the Zombie songs we all know and love!"<ref>http://www.john-5.comwww.john-5.com</ref>It was reported that Zombie was looking to quit the music industry to concentrate on his movie career until he began to work with John 5.

“Camp Freddy asked me to do this benefit, just to play one song, at the Arrowhead Pond (in [[Anaheim]], [[California]]) for this tsunami relief thing.And John was there, and we played one song, 'Thunderkiss,' and it kicked ass and he's a supercool guy and I was like, 'this is perfect.'John said, 'Do you need a guitar player for Ozzfest?' I said, 'Yes.'He said, 'I wanna do it,' I said, 'Perfect, done.'"-Rob Zombie on John 5<ref></ref> 

Lowery worked on Rob Zombie's 2006 album ''[[Educated Horses]]'', co-writing eight out of eleven tracks with Zombie.When he left Loser, Lowery took up the role of Rob Zombie guitarist as a permanent gig.“Rob is the best I have worked with.He is great.We have a great time on stage together.It has been the single greatest experience I have had working with someone, hands down.<ref>http://www.thegauntlet.com/interviews/338/Zombie,-Rob.htmlthegauntlet.com/interviews</ref>Lowery is also working on the musical score for Rob Zombie's sixth feature-length film, ''Tyrannosaurus Rex''.John is also the guitarist on Rob's latest album, ''[[Hellbilly Deluxe 2]]'' which was released February 2, 2010.<ref></ref>In October 2011, Zombie confirmed by his Facebook <ref></ref> account that John 5 would be composing the soundtrack to Rob Zombie's latest movie, The Lords of Salem.This was also confirmed on the official John 5 website 

 
Starting in 2004 with ''Vertigo'', Lowery has gone on to record a total of five instrumental records.His works have had many guest players on them.For example ''Songs for Sanity'' saw Albert Lee guesting, and other records have seen guest spots from Steve Vai, Joe Satriani and Jim Root.In 2009, John released a remix album, ''[[Remixploitation]]''. Lowery has also released an instructional DVD entitled ''The Devil Knows My Name'' (2007).In July 2009, on his twitter page, John 5 announced that he is now six tracks into the next solo album.<ref></ref>On October 2, 2009, he played with [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] at a tribute to the [[Mirage Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]].<ref></ref>In a twitter update January 6, 2010 John 5 had this to say about the progress of his upcoming 5th studio album 

He often names his songs after famous murderers, (i.e.Edward Gein ("Gein with Envy", ''Songs for Sanity'',) Albert Fish ("Werewolf of Westeria", ''The Devil Knows My Name'') or torture devices (see any song from ''Requiem'').'''Current Guitars:'''

  SENTENCES: '''Noodle''' (born 31 October 1990 in [[Osaka]], [[Japan]]) is a musician and member of the [[virtual band]] [[Gorillaz]].She provides the guitar and keyboard, as well as some main and backing vocals for the band.She, like all other Gorillaz members, was created by [[Damon Albarn]] and [[Jamie Hewlett]].She was inspired by guitarist Julie Sims, of the band [[Tiger (band)|Tiger]].<ref>http://www.tank-girl.com/2011/06/saturday-pop-slot-39-on-the-rose-by-tiger/</ref>Noodle arrived on Murdoc's doorstep in a [[FedEx]] crate, in immediate response to the ad they placed for a guitarist in ''[[NME]]''.She could not speak any English beyond the word "Noodle", thus earning her name.She quickly got settled in England with the Gorillaz, and was accepted as the fourth member of the band.In ''[[Rise of the Ogre]]'', it is revealed that during the band's hiatus in November 2003, Noodle went back to Japan to find out the truth about her past after being haunted by strange nightmares while on tour.Upon her return to Japan, Noodle regained her memory after hearing the code-phrase "ocean bacon" at a restaurant.There she coincidentally met with her creator/mentor, Mr. Kyuzo, who was working as the head chef in the restaurant.Kyuzo helped her make sense of her lost memories: Noodle is, in fact, part of a secret government super soldier project, trained specially as a musician.As a result, she is a master of many weapons, languages, and musical instruments, with a specialty in the guitar, both as a musical instrument, and a weapon.Out of the 23 children created for the project, Noodle was the only one to survive 

Noodle regained the ability to speak English, along with her memories, and was the first member of Gorillaz to return to Kong Studios after their failed international tour.She was alone at Kong Studios for nearly six months 

 
In March 2006, the Gorillaz video "[[El Mañana (song)|El Mañana]]" was released.In the days preceding the release of the video, cardboard boxes were found in the Kong Studios lobby.The boxes soon moved to Noodle's room, and each day, her room was shown to be more and more packed away until the room was entirely barren.At the same time, the Slowboat (AKA Windmill Island) from the "[[Feel Good Inc.]]" music video appeared outside of Kong Studios on the website's splash page.Shortly before the release of "El Mañana", the windmill was seen flying away.The video is a continuation of the "Feel Good Inc." video, once again depicting Noodle on the Slowboat, although she appears to be much older in the "El Mañana" video than when she is shown in the "Feel Good Inc" video.The video concludes with the helicopters bombing the crashed windmill.Two days after the video's release, cracks appeared on the walls of Noodle's room on the website (which spread to the ground floor lobby) and the clock on her wall labelled "Armageddon" (the only piece of furniture left behind) gained a fourth hand, and fell to the floor.The cracks grew to the point that part of the roof collapsed, exposing the outdoor sky.Near the end of the month, more boxes were found in the Kong Studios lobby, one of which was labelled "DedEx".They disappeared after the lobby was destroyed.In the book ''Rise of the Ogre'', Murdoc reveals that the "El Mañana" video was indeed "staged" and that Noodle is still "alive".It was stated by Murdoc that Noodle had been planning to leave after ''Demon Days''.According to Murdoc, Noodle is in the Maldives "chilling out", though that was the interview before receiving a transmission from Noodle.When the Gorillaz web site still allowed visitors to tour Kong Studios, a radio could be heard in the basement, broadcasting a distress call from Noodle.The message was printed as an [[epilogue]] in the Gorillaz book, ''Rise of the Ogre'':



According to a interview with ''Q'' magazine, Murdoc found that Noodle had fallen foul of another attempt to take his soul, this time a group of spirits who had taken advantage of Russel's spirit-channelling capabilities.Armed with an ancient spellbook, he set off into the underworld, but failed to find her.On 22 January 2010, Murdoc hijacked the online [[NME Radio]] and [[Yahoo!]] radio broadcasts to promote the new Gorillaz album, ''[[Plastic Beach]]''.Murdoc claimed that Noodle was never rescued after the "El Mañana" video, and that his supposed rescue attempt was a drunken delusion.With Russel's whereabouts still unknown, he and 2D have been working on the third album with the help of a Noodle [[cyborg]] constructed from Noodle's DNA from the windmill wreckage.However, due to the improbability of anything Murdoc says and the fact that only DNA was gathered, the status of the real Noodle was in question.It has since been confirmed that the real Noodle is alive.Recently, Murdoc has called Noodle his greatest asset.Noodle is confirmed to be alive in an exclusive new Gorillaz video for the single "[[On Melancholy Hill]]".In the video, a luxury cruise ship (called the "M.Harriet") is being bombarded by torpedoes coming from pirate WWII Corsairs flying overhead.A crew member rushes over to cabin 13 to warn Noodle (who is sitting, wearing an [[Oni (folklore)|oni]] mask) that the ship is under attack by pirates and to take her to the lifeboats.Noodle walks over to her briefcase and opens it, revealing a [[Thompson submachine gun]].She then passes the confused crew member and heads out to face the pirates.She kills one of the pirates, but the other drops a bomb on the ship, sinking it.Noodle is seen floating out to sea in a lifeboat which is later picked up by the now-giant Russel.Murdoc has since posted on his Twitter page that he was surprised to see the real Noodle alive and is claiming to be on his way to retrieve her.In one of the visuals for the live show, Noodle is seen playing a melodica to the track "Broken".In the storyboard for the potential video for "[[Rhinestone Eyes]]", Noodle is seen to be carried on the top of the giant Russel's head as he swims towards Plastic Beach.Once the fighting stops near the end of the storyboard, she is seen to step out of Russel's mouth, and removes her cat oni mask, revealing some scarring to her face and eye.For the ''[[Demon Days]]'' album, Noodle was seen with a notably different look, no longer sporting her trademark radio helmet as well as having a noticeably more feminine fashion style and lighter skin tone.She was also noticeably taller with thinner legs, and occasionally seen sporting a monkey named Mike.In the video for "[[El Mañana]]" she has green eyes, which contradicts the previous videos where her eyes are seen: "[[19-2000]]", "[[Rock the House]]", and "[[Dare (song)|Dare]]".In these videos she is depicted as having black eyes with no irises or pupils, unlike 2-D whose eyes were fractured by Murdoc's stolen Vauxhall Astra, but this difference is likely because the pan of the video was zoomed entirely on her eye, making the green noticeable.Most of the time, though, Noodle's eyes are covered by her hair.In a recent Q&A, Jamie Hewlett stated that Noodle's eye color varies depending on distance 

In Phase One, her hair was completely black, and she was always wearing her helmet (as seen on Brit Awards Show 2002), except for select live performances.During Phase Two, Noodle's hair became purple and blue tinted and somewhat longer, covering her eyes.According to the original promotional booklet, Noodle was sixteen as of January 2006.It was confirmed by a Gorillaz e-mail sent out on Halloween that she was born on that day, 31 October, in 1990.In "[[On Melancholy Hill]]", Noodle is seen wearing red lipstick and her body is noticeably more matured with her height and body structure, since she should be 19 years old in this video.(That is, if the Gorillaz have been paying attention to dates.)She is also seen wearing a white and green cat mask.Underneath the cat mask is a large, dark bruise on the right side of her face.During Phase One of Gorillaz, Noodle could only speak Japanese, with the exceptions of her bandmates' names and small words such as "duh" or "yeah", and Russel had translated for her 

It was not until Phase Two with the ''Demon Days'' album that anyone actually heard her fluently speak English conversationally.Noodle is a fan of [[Hayao Miyazaki|Miyazaki]]'s films.She enjoyed ''[[Spirited Away]]'' and got inspiration for the "[[Feel Good Inc.]]" video from ''[[Castle in the Sky]]'' 

Also, on her computer in Kong, it is shown in the file '21_facts' that she is interested in that number.This file also features a reference to [[Prince (musician)|Prince]].In ''Rise of the Ogre'', many pictures of Noodle include her holding a guitar in her left hand, showing that she is right-handed.(Irrelevantbecause not many people do things with the opposite hand than they write with.)However, in pictures for the Gorillaz bite "Search for a Star", she can be seen holding a pencil in her left hand.This is further supported in the "On Melancholy Hill" music video, where in which both she and her cyborg clone are shown firing their guns in a left-handed fashion.There are several people who make up the identity of Noodle, they include former [[Cibo Matto]] vocalist [[Miho Hatori]] and [[Talking Heads]]' [[Tina Weymouth]], who both had provided singing vocals for Noodle on the first album 

In ''[[Plastic Beach]]'', it's been a matter of debate for fans as to who is "Noodle".While some argue that [[Yukimi Nagano]] of [[Little Dragon]] provides either Noodle's voice or that of her cyborg clone in "Empire Ants" and "[[Plastic Beach|To Binge]]" and that her guitar portions were provided by whoever plays guitar on a given song, including Simon Katz, [[Simon Tong]], and [[Damon Albarn]], some argue she is not at all on the album.The question is where the video of "On Melancholy Hill" takes place chronologically: if the video is all the collaborators on their way to Plastic Beach, then that means Noodle may have arrived in time to play a role.But during production of the album this was never implied and obviously the twitter posts by Murdoc came out after the album was released.Phase 3 has no named "voice coach" as of yet for Noodle or Cyborg.Her voice does appear in the demo "Electric Shock" and "[[Rhinestone Eyes]]" but again, no one has yet been confirmed.Noodle is most often seen with either a yellow Fender Telecaster, a Gibson Les Paul or a fictional, generic red guitar.She also has an acoustic guitar which is seen in "Feel Good Inc.", "El Mañana" and "On Melancholy Hill".'''Cyborg Noodle''' was the newest member for [[virtual band]] Gorillaz created for their album ''Plastic Beach''.In the storyline, she was created by the band leader, Murdoc, as a replacement for the band's original guitarist, Noodle, whose whereabouts were allegedly unknown.She was created through the use of cybernetic prosthetics as well as some DNA samples of Noodle that were salvaged from the wreckage of the flying windmill island which was destroyed in the "El Mañana" music video.She serves as both a guitarist and a "gun-slinging bodyguard" for Murdoc.Aside from her built-in knowledge of musical instruments and theory, Cyborg Noodle also has a vast knowledge of weapons and fighting techniques, as well as basic skills, much like Noodle.Unlike the original Noodle's reserved and calm nature, Cyborg Noodle was programmed by Murdoc to take on even the riskiest tasks without hesitation by any means necessary, making her in some ways a robotic mercenary.She seems to malfunction in "[[Stylo (song)|Stylo]]" due to a thunderstorm halfway through the video and having been previously shot in the head, but later repairs herself, as seen in "[[On Melancholy Hill]]".Murdoc revealed in a radio interview that she malfunctioned and tried to kill him,then Noodle destroyed the cyborg.The cyborg replica retains all of Noodle's physical characteristics and mannerisms but not her memories or tastes.It is also trained to obey Murdoc's every command.The cyborg gave an interview for the tabloid magazine ''[[Us Weekly]]'', in which it revealed that it prefers pop music, unlike the original Noodle's "rock-chick" style.It also claims to enjoy the ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|Twilight]]'' films and their starring actor, [[Robert Pattinson]].This further tells of the incomplete nature of the cyborg, as the real Noodle would have rejected both as "False Icons", in accordance with the ideals she spoke of in ''Rise of the Ogre''.Cyborg Noodle first appears in the music video for the ''[[Plastic Beach]]'' track "[[Stylo (song)|Stylo]]", where it has been shot multiple times, and shuts down shortly after firing upon a police car.The cyborg survives, and Murdoc explains in the ''Plastic Beach Experience'' video that she is in constant need of charging whenever not being used.In the documentary that comes with the Experience edition of the album, Jamie Hewlett refers to the cyborg as "Evil Noodle".In the "Rhinestone Eyes" music video, she is shown hiding behind some palm trees clutching two Uzis as the island is being attacked by the Boogieman and pirates.A small group of collaborators, who seem to be Snoop Dogg and De La Soul, are hiding against a wall.Cyborg Noodle locks eyes with one of the De La Soul members and she is seen smiling.Fluid is seen leaking out of her eye, nose, and mouth, the cause unknown.[[Category:Fictional martial artists]]

  SENTENCES: '''Tony Furtado''' (born October 18, 1967) is an American [[banjo]] player and [[slide guitar]], and [[singer/songwriter]].player of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[Italian people|Italian]] heritage who was born in [[Oakland, California]].He currently resides in [[Portland, Oregon]].Tony Furtado became a [[banjo]] player in sixth grade after doing a report on the instrument, making a rough banjo out of household items and studying the history of it.By 19, he had won a pair of National Bluegrass Banjo Championships.As a young banjo player, Furtado found himself playing the genre of music most represented by the instrument - [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]].But all along, he was listening to everything from Celtic music, Jazz, American Folk as well as artists like [[Tom Petty]] and [[Jackson Browne]], [[MTV]] was unnavoidable in the early 80s!At the same time, he was delving into his parents collection of [[classic rock]] records (The Who, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Ozark Mountain Daredevils, etc...).At the ripe age of 19, Furtado had already earned himself a reputation as a young banjo prodigy, winning two National Bluegrass Banjo Championships.Albeit the press and praise as one of the most promising bluegrass artists, Furtado decided that one genre wasn’t enough for him.Creatively, he had something more to express.“I don’t think I could ever be happy staying in any one place musically,” says Tony Furtado.Furtado then picked up the slide guitar and soon established that his dexterity transitioned with ease.Using fingers and a bottleneck, he absorbed everything he could from albums by Ry Cooder, Fred McDowell, David Lindley and Blind Willie Johnson.He was soon writing music with the slide guitar and featured it on his 1996 Rounder Records release, "Roll My Blues Away".After a move to Colorado, where he based his band, "[[Tony Furtado Band]]" as well as [[Tony furtado and the American Gypsies|"Tony Furtado and The American Gypsies"]], Furtado started his "road-dog" life, playing as many as 250 days on the road.The music was mostly instrumental based, high energy folk-rock, but it wasn’t long before Furtado began writing songs.Though his previously released banjo albums featured the vocals of talents such as Allison Krauss, Tim O'Brien and Kelly Joe Phelps, this driven artist chose to add singer to his songwriter and instrumental titles.Looking back, he says:

<blockquote>“I think I was kind of doomed to be a multi-genre player from the start.”<ref>[http://www.telluridegateway.com/articles/2007/03/09/the_pulse/pulse03.txt"Furtado brings eclectic bag of tricks to Opera House"] by Katie Klingsporn, March 8, 2007 ''Telluride Daily Planet''.</ref></blockquote>[[Image:Tony Furtado 2.jpg|left|thumb|Fox Theater, Boulder, Colorado<br>February 8, 2008<br>Image by [http://www.flickr.com/people/98107165@N00tammi_g]]]
Furtado's 1987 win at the National Banjo Competition (a feat he would repeat in 1991) led to a touring sideman stint with bluegrass musician ([[fiddle]]) [[Laurie Lewis]] (Laurie Lewis and Grant Street) and the launch of his professional career.But, [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] was only one style of music that interested Mr. Furtado.He has spent his decades in the music business fusing bluegrass, [[Country music|country]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[blues]], [[jazz]], and [[Folk music|folk]] (both [[United States|American]] and [[Europe]]an) on his expanding instrument arsenal of [[banjo]], [[guitar]], [[slide guitar]] and [[voice]].<ref>[http://www.modernguitars.com/archives/002779.html "Tony Furtado Interview"] by Tom Watson, January 18, 2007 ''Modern Guitars''.</ref>A Tony Furtado show has something to offer everyone.He is a real musician with a riveting voice who blends rock music with frequents of bluesy, pop, and country.Furtado’s beyond impressive, furious slide guitar skills and 25+ years of banjo experience will blow away the music geeks

'''Tony Furtado Brings it Home on Golden'''

If you’ve followed Tony Furtado’s prolific music career at all you won’t be surprised to know that his 15th album, Golden, is loaded with several impressive firsts.For the first time, he has self-produced and penned every track.It is also the first time his own artwork- a sculpture of a two-headed rabbit- has been featured on the cover.However, on what is arguably his most engaging, masterful recording to date, one first marks this album more than any other.After 20 years of recording, touring basically living on the road, it is the first time Furtado has ever recorded an album in the town that he calls home.Recorded, mixed and co-produced by friend and engineer Rob Stroup at 8-Ball Studio in Portland, OR, Golden, is the product of Furtado surrounded by the comforts of home, weaving his way through the diverse cultural fabric of a city rich with music, art and talent.In classic Furtado fashion, he explores the hills and valleys of familiar and new musical territory ranging from Americana, Celtic and folk to indie rock and pop.And while his award-winning playing and unforgettable leads are present throughout, it is his vocal presence, diverse arrangements and songwriting that take center stage on Golden.From the sad horns and heartbreaking wait for “Angelina” to the broken man portrayed in the pedal steel-driven ballad “Man Down,” and poignant, other-worldly ode “Angels We Know,” his relaxed vocal delivery, pointed stories and melodic phrasing bring a powerful authenticity to each song.Combined with masterful production- a swirling undercurrent of unique instrumentation, percussion, and sweet harmonies- makes Golden a truly landmark album for Furtado.Inspiration for the songs and music came from his many experiences around the River City while on hiatus from the road.His weekly residencies at local venues The Woods and The Secret Society provided him an opportunity to broaden his palette and share his tunes with a huge swath of songwriters, including Casey Neill, Jeremy Wilson, Dangermuffin and Kenny White.An online songwriting “club” hosted by Adam Levy where he was joined by songwriters like Ari Hest, Vienna Teng, and Garrison Starr, spawned the rootsy “In the Hollow” and the driving devilry of “Can’t Lie Down.”Even the local art provided inspiration.The infectious instrumental “Portlandia” is classic Furtado and named after a Raymond Kaskey sculpture located above the entrance of a downtown building.“In the past 5 years, I’ve really worked my way into the fabric of this town,” said Furtado.“The experiences I’ve had, the talented people I’ve met- it just felt right to make the record here.It was so easy to pop in or out of the studio when I wanted to overdub something or have a friend come in to play on a tune.It allowed for a lot of collaboration and inspiration to be captured from everyday life.”Many of Furtado’s local compadres, added their talents to the Golden sessions- artists like Paul Brainard (pedal steel), Ezra Holbrook (vocals), Jim Brunberg (vocals), Anders Bergstrom (drums), Stephanie Schneiderman (vocals), Scott Law (mandolin), Drew Shoals (drums), Tye North (bass) and Johnny Connolly (accordion)- are heard throughout.An award winning banjo and slide guitar player who has recorded with the likes of Allison Krauss, Kelly Joe Phelps and Jerry Douglas, Tony Furtado has lived primarily on the road for the last two decades.And while he’s resided in many towns, they’ve mostly been temporary spaces.Now this consummate troubadour and indie label darling has finally found a place to call home.And if Golden is any indication of what home can do, we all hope he never leaves.He currently resides in [[Portland, Oregon]], and tours the [[U.S.]] extensively.Mr. Furtado mixes Americana, [[Folk music|folk]], indie-rock, [[blues music|blues]], and [[jazz]] styles.<ref>[http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?xid=1001 "Tony Furtado goes for a lucky 'Thirteen'"] by Jason MacNeil January 2007 ''Country Standard Time''.</ref>[[Category:American bluegrass musicians]]

  SENTENCES: '''Marissa Nadler''' (born April 5, 1981) is an [[United States|American]] [[Dream pop|dream-folk]] singer-songwriter and [[fine art]]ist based in Boston.Marissa Nadler was exposed to art at a young age through her mother Pamela, an abstract painter, and her older brother Stuart, a guitarist and writer.Nadler studied painting at [[Rhode Island School of Design]] and was an art teacher in [[Harlem]], [[New York]] for a short time.However, music soon became her favored artistic outlet.As a teenager, she learned to play guitar from her brother in a style similar to cotton picking, playing a steady bass pattern with the thumb and filling out syncopated rhythms with the index finger.<ref>http://wearsthetrousers.com/2009/03/20/marissa-nadler-little-hells-2009/</ref><refname="boston.com">http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2006/09/15/through_music_she_builds_her_own_myth/</ref>After her brother left his guitar at home and went off to college, she taught herself to play and began writing songs.While exploring old artistic techniques such as illustration, painting, bookbinding, [[woodcarving]] and [[encaustic painting]], she also began to further hone her songwriting craft.She subsequently recorded an album titled "Autumn Rose", as well as another EP, both of which have never been released.Marissa Nadler released her first album, ''[[Ballads of Living and Dying]]'', on [[Eclipse Records]] in 2004 

Her fourth full-length record, ''[[Little Hells]]'', was released March 3, 2009, receiving high praise from many critics including 4 Star reviews from magazines such as Mojo, Rolling Stone in France and Germany, Uncut, Q.It received an 8.3 from Pitchforkmedia.com, with critic Grayson Currin writing, "Surrounded by little else but her own melancholy, Nadler sums up her career's existential despair: 'Ghosts and lovers/ They will haunt you for a while,' she sings.And while they do, Little Hells suggests through 10 of Nadler's best songs yet, the sadness will either kill you or keep you going."<ref>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12813-little-hells</ref>In early 2010 she contributed to the black metal project [[Xasthur]], with the final album "Portal of Sorrow".<ref>http://metal-archives.com/release.php?id=269609</ref>On June 14, 2011, an [[Marissa Nadler (album)|eponymous record]] was released worldwide on Nadler's own label, Box of Cedar Records.This record will be followed by a four song EP entitled ''Rain Arrangement''.Her voice was described by the popular online music website [[Pitchfork Media]] as "a voice you would follow straight into [[Hades]]".In the ''[[Boston Globe]]'', her voice and music is described: "She has a voice that, in mythological times, could have lured men to their deaths at sea, an intoxicating soprano drenched in gauzy reverb that hits bell-clear heights, lingers, and tapers off like rings of smoke.Hardly anyone considers Nadler a folk musician."<ref name="boston.com"/>Music critics describe Nadler's songs as having American Gothic leanings 

Singing in a [[mezzo-soprano]], the foundation of her songs are her [[acoustic guitar]], often accompanied by a variety of instruments and an ambient reverb-laden production.She has been known to play in open tunings on several songs.Her influences include [[Nina Simone]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Patti Smith]], [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Kate Bush]], and [[Leonard Cohen]].<!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]] -->

  SENTENCES: '''Bill Keith''' (b.December 20, 1939) is a five-string banjoist who made a significant contribution to the stylistic development of the instrument.In the 1960s he introduced a variation on the popular "[[Scruggs style]]" of [[Banjo#Five-string_banjo|banjo]] playing (an integral element of [[bluegrass music]]) which would soon become known as melodic style, or "[[Keith style]]."<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/bill-keith?cat=entertainment Bill Keith: Information and Much More from Answers.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

 
'''William Bradford Keith''' was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].In 1963 he became a member of [[Bill Monroe]]'s Bluegrass Boys.Keith's recordings and performances during these nine months with Monroe permanently altered banjo playing, and his style has become an important part of the playing styles of many banjoists.After leaving the Bluegrass Boys, he joined "[[Jim Kweskin]] Jug Band" playing plectrum banjo.He began playing the steel guitar and soon after 1968, found himself working together with [[Ian and Sylvia]] and [[Jonathan Edwards (musician)|Jonathan Edwards]].In the 1970s Keith recorded for [[Rounder Records]].Over the years he has performed with several other musicians, such as [[Clarence White]] and [[David Grisman]] in [[Muleskinner (band)|Muleskinner]], [[Tony Trischka]], Jim Rooney and Jim Collier.Today, [[Keith style]] is still regarded as modern or progressive in the context of bluegrass banjo playing.Keith made a mechanical contribution to the banjo, as well.He designed a specialized type of banjo tuning peg that facilitates changing quickly from one open tuning to another, while playing.Earlier famed banjoist [[Earl Scruggs]] had designed a set of cams which were added to the banjo to perform this task.Keith's invention made the extra hardware unnecessary, replacing two of the tuning machines already on the banjo —  a more elegant solution.Scruggs himself became a partner in the venture for a while, and the product was known as "Scruggs-Keith Pegs".Known today simply as Keith Pegs, they remain the state of the art, and Bill Keith continues to manufacture and market them personally as the primary product of his own company, the Beacon Banjo Company.[[Category:1939 births]]

  SENTENCES: '''Elizabeth "Libba" Cotten''' (January 5, 1895 – June 29, 1987) was an [[United States|American]] blues and folk [[musician]], [[singer]], and [[songwriter]].A self-taught left-handed guitarist, Cotten developed her own original style.Her approach involved using a right-handed guitar (usually in standard tuning), not re-strung for left-handed playing, essentially, holding a right-handed guitar upside down.This position required her to play the bass lines with her fingers and the melody with her thumb.Her signature [[alternating bass]] style has become known as "Cotten picking".Elizabeth Nevills was born in [[Carrboro, North Carolina]], at the border of Chapel Hill, to a musical family.Her parents were George Nevills and Louise Price Nevills.Elizabeth was the youngest of five children.At age seven, Cotten began to play her older brother's [[banjo]].By eight years old, she was playing songs.At 11, after scraping together some money, she bought her own [[guitar]].She became very good at playing the instrument, which she named "Stella."<ref></ref>By her early teens she was writing her own songs, one of which, "[[Freight Train (song)|Freight Train]]", would go on to be one of her most recognized.Cotten wrote "Freight Train" when she saw a train pass by her house on Lloyd Street in [[Carrboro, North Carolina]].<refname="chapelhillnews"></ref>

Around the age of 13, Cotten began working as a maid along with her mother.Soon after at age 15, she was married to Frank Cotten.The couple had a daughter named Lillie, and soon after young Elizabeth gave up guitar playing for [[family]] and [[Christian Church|church]].Elizabeth, Frank and their daughter Lillie moved around eastern [[United States]] for a number of years between [[North Carolina]], [[New York]], and [[Washington, D.C.]], finally settling in the D.C. area.When Lillie married, Elizabeth divorced Frank and moved in with her daughter and her family.Cotten had retired from the guitar for 25 years, except for occasional church performances.It wasn't until she reached her 60s that she began recording and performing publicly.She was discovered by the folk-singing Seeger family while she was working for them as a housekeeper.While working for a brief stint in a department store, Cotten helped a child wandering through the aisles find her mother.The child was Penny Seeger, and the mother was composer [[Ruth Crawford Seeger]].Soon after this, Elizabeth again began working as a maid, caring for Ruth Crawford Seeger and [[Charles Seeger]]'s children, [[Mike Seeger|Mike]], [[Peggy Seeger|Peggy]], Barbara, and Penny.While working with the Seegers (a voraciously musical family) she remembered her own guitar playing from 40 years prior and picked up the instrument again to relearn almost from scratch.During the later half of the 1950s, [[Mike Seeger]] began making bedroom [[reel to reel]] recordings of Cotten's songs in her house.The culmination of these recordings would later go on the album ''Folksongs and Instrumentals with Guitar'', which was released on [[Folkways Records]].Since its release, her songs, especially her signature track, "Freight Train", written when she was 11, have been covered by [[Peter, Paul, and Mary]], [[Jerry Garcia]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Devendra Banhart]], [[Laura Gibson]], [[Laura Veirs]], [[His Name Is Alive]] and [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]].Shortly afterwards, she began playing selected joint shows with Mike Seeger, the first of which was in 1960 at [[Swarthmore College]].One of her songs, "Ain't Got No Honey Baby Now", was in fact recorded by [[Blind Boy Fuller]] under the title "Lost Lover Blues" in 1940.Over the course of the early 1960s, Cotten went on to play more shows with big names in the burgeoning [[American folk music revival|folk revival]].Some of these included [[Mississippi John Hurt]], [[John Lee Hooker]], and [[Muddy Waters]] at venues such as the [[Newport Folk Festival]] and the [[Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife]].The newfound interest in her work inspired her to write more material to play and in 1967, she released a record created with her grandchildren which took its name from one of the songs she had written, ''[[Shake Sugaree]]''.Using profits from her touring and record releases, as well as from the many awards given to her for contribution to the folk arts, Elizabeth moved with her daughter and grandchildren from Washington and bought a house in [[Syracuse, New York]].She continued touring and releasing records well into her 80s.In 1984 she won the Grammy Award for "Best Ethnic or Traditional Recording" for her album on Arhoolie Records, ''Elizabeth Cotten Live''.When accepting the award in [[Los Angeles]], her comment was "Thank you.I only wish I had my guitar so I could play a song for you all".In 1989, Cotten was one of 75 influential [[African-American]] women chosen to be included in the photo documentary, ''[[I Dream a World]].''Elizabeth Cotten died in [[Syracuse, New York]], at the age of 92.Elizabeth Cotten began writing music while toying around with her older brother's banjo.She was left-handed so she played the banjo "backwards".Later, when she transferred her songs to the guitar, a unique style was formed, since on the banjo the uppermost string is not a bass string, as on the guitar but a short high pitched string called a drone string.This required her to adopt a unique style for the guitar, which she first played with all finger down strokes like a banjo.Later this evolved into a unique style of finger picking, and her signature, alternating bass style is known as "Cotten Picking".Her unmistakably original [[Chord (music)|chords]], melodies and [[finger picking]] techniques would go on to influence many other musicians.[[Category:1895 births]]

  SENTENCES: '''Molly O'Day''' (July 9, 1923 – December 5, 1987) was an American [[country music]] vocalist who had some degree of fame and commercial success in the late 1940s.Despite her short recording career, 5 years, she became a legend in her own lifetime.Molly is also the cousin of former [[burlesque]] dancer/stripper [[Blaze Starr]].'''Lois LaVerne Williamson''' was born on a farm in [[Pike County, Kentucky]], as the daughter of Joseph and Hester Williamson.Her father Joseph supported the family as a coalminer.Neither of her parents played music but Lois got together with her two brothers, Cecil and Joe,  to practice singing and playing.Lois and her two brothers, who called themselves Skeets and Duke, began performing at local dances.In 1939 Skeets was hired to perform in a radio band: ''Ervin Staggs and His Radio Ramblers'' at WCHS, [[Charleston, West Virginia]].One of the more famous members of the group was Johnnie Bailes.That same year Molly also joined the ''Radio Ramblers'' as a vocalist under the pseudonym ''Mountain Fern''.She also worked with a banjoist called Murphy McClees and changed her name to ''Dixie Lee''.Within a couple of months, she and her two brothers quit and moved to [[Williamson, West Virginia]], to perform at a local radio station.In 1940 Lois and her two brothers moved to [[Beckley, West Virginia]], to join the ''Happy Valley Boys'' led by Johnnie Bailes.The band didn't make much money so it disintegrated in the fall of 1940.Lois, now unemployed, applied for the position as a vocalist in the band ''Lynn Davis and His Forty-Niners'', who had performed on WHIS in [[Bluefield, West Virginia]] for the past four years.A few months later, on April 5, 1941, Lynn Davis and Lois Williamson were married.''The Forty-Niners'' appeared on several locations in the southeast and during one gig in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], [[Hank Williams]] performed with the group.In 1941 Lois changed her name to ''Molly O'Day'' since there already existed another singer named ''Dixie Lee''.After a couple of years, in 1945, Lynn decided to change the band's name to the ''Cumberland Mountain Folks''.Since World War II had come to an end, people were eagerly looking for entertainment and the new band became a hot act.In the summer of 1946, the head of [[Acuff-Rose Music|Acuff-Rose]], [[Fred Rose (musician)|Fred Rose]] heard Molly sing ''Tramp on the Street,'' a Grady Cole song she learned from Williams.Rose almost immediately arranged a recording contract with [[Columbia Records]].''Molly O'Day & The Cumberland Mountain Folks'' made their first recordings on December 16, 1946.On these first recordings, [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] legend [[Mac Wiseman]] appeared on bass.During her first years as a recording artist Molly O'Day's popularity increased but she started to have doubts about her life's choice.By 1951 she had made her last recording session for [[Columbia Records]].Although Molly O'Day recorded albums for Bob Mooney's Rem label (later reissued on [[Starday]]) and GRS Records in the 1960s, she preferred to sing in churches and do evangelistic work.Both the [[Smithsonian Institution]]  and [[Ralph Stanley]] tried without success to get her back onstage.In February 1974, Molly and Lynn started a program on a Christian radio station in Huntington, West Virginia featuring gospel recordings.In the 1980s her health began to deteriorate after she was diagnosed with cancer.She died on December 5, 1987, aged 64, at the Cabell Huntington Hospital in [[Huntington, West Virginia]].She was survived by her husband.[[Category:1923 births]]

<blockquote>
"For the record: Though our professional circles did cross-over slightly...I never had the honour or pleasure of meeting Michael Jackson personally, nor did we ever correspond on matters of our professions, personal lives or faiths."</blockquote>
On the topic of conversion, Wharnsby also stated:
<blockquote>
"My approach to faith does not include concepts of "conversion/reversion" or "propagation", so the very idea that I would have even tried to "convert" Mr. Jackson (or anyone else for that matter) to my spiritual perspective, is silly."</blockquote>
In November 2009 Dawud Wharnsby's name was included in the category of "Entertainment and The Arts" on a list of the 500 Most Influential Muslims, compiled by The Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Center (Jordon),<ref></ref> and published with support of Georgetown University’s Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding.<ref></ref>[[Category:1972 births]]

  SENTENCES: '''David Wolfenberger''' (born April 19, 1969 in [[Tuscola, Illinois]]) is a [[singer/songwriter]] from [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].Former frontman for The Marshwiggles and Thom Scarecrow, Wolfenberger has 3 solo CDs to date 

 
In 1997 Wolfenberger's band the Marshwiggles released their first and only album ''Stone Soup'' on the local Cincinnati label [[Blue Jordan Records]].It was played nationally and the band toured regionally to sizable crowds but broke up during the recording of their second album just prior to its completion and release.This album has never been released although tracks from it have shown up on Blue Jordan compilations.Wolfenberger then formed the band Thom Scarecrow with [[acoustic guitar]]ist [[Jason Dennie]] and fellow Marshwiggles, Tony Moore and [[Joshua Seurkamp]].This would be a short lived ensemble lasting just over a year.In [[1999]] Wolfenberger's first solo album, ''Tales From Thom Scarecrow'' was released and won him Artist of the Year in his hometown at the [[Cincinnati Entertainment Awards]] as well as notoriety abroad from such notable media as the ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' in [[Milan]], [[Italy]] which stated that "Wolfenberger puts forth folk with dark nuances, the grand introspective songs are illuminated with emotions in this exhibition of his life."<ref>Pratelli,Maurizio, "Wolfenberger: Musica Folk con Venature Dark", ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', January 7, 2001</ref>

In [[2000]] he joined iconoclastic songwriters [[Mark Olson]] and [[Victoria Williams]] as a touring and recording member of the [[Original Harmony Ridge Creekdippers]].In 2001 while still touring with the Creekdippers Wolfenberger recorded his second solo album with his band entitled ''World of the Satisfyn' Place''.This album was decidedly more [[Traditional music|roots]] oriented than his first (a return to his style with the Marshwiggles and Thom Scarecrow) and swung wildly from raucous to thoughtful on a song to song basis.,<ref>Nager,Larry, ''The Blue Jordan Sound: Wolfenberger's Songs, Cincinnati Musicians Set Standard'', Cincinnati Enquirer, October 1, 2001 [http://bluejordan.com/david/EnquirerRev2.htm]</ref>It was even more well received by the critics.''The [[Detroit Metro Times]]'' stated that "Wolfenberger ambles between homespun Appalachian traditions and classic pop and country forms with an unwavering dedication to simple, gorgeous melodies that are alternately uplifting and devastating."<ref>Cavalieri,Nate, ''[[Detroit Metro Times]]'', January 23, 2002</ref> While in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Americana-UK]] called it "a 100% solid gold classic".<ref>Whitfield,Mark, [[Americana-UK]], April 22, 2002</ref> and his hometown Cincinnati press named it "one of the best albums (local or national) of the year".<ref>Breen,Mike, "Top Discs of 2001", [[CityBeat]], January 17, 2002</ref>

In the following two years he would appear on two Creekdipper albums, release a free folk [[Gospel music|gospel]] album under the pseudonym Sunrise for Someone and eventually in 2003 stop touring and recording with the Creekdippers although maintaining a close relationship, which would become apparent with the release of his third solo album entitled ''[[Portrait of Narcissus]]'' in 2006 which featured fellow Creekdippers, [[Victoria Williams]], [[Joshua Grange]] (by then a regular member of [[Dwight Yoakam]]'s band), and fellow [[Indie music|independent]] folkie [[Michelle Shocked]].This would be Wolfenberger's first album to be distributed beyond America and Europe into Asia and Australia due to its release by recently revived [[Fundamental Records]].It would even end up at #12 on the independent [[Euro Americana Chart]]<ref>Euro Americana Chart, http://euroamericanachart.com, April 2006</ref>

In July 2008 Wolfenberger recorded and made available another folk gospel project under the pseudonym Sunrise for Someone entitled ''Summer Lake Champion''.In August of the same year he released ''Just Burned Upon The Page'' a live and mostly solo recording of 7 songs.The proceeds benefit the [[Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation]].[[Category:Living people]]

  SENTENCES: '''The Rev. Andrew W. Jenkins''' (November 26, 1885, [[Jenkinsburg, Georgia|Jenkinsburg]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] – April 25, 1957, [[Thomaston, Georgia]]<ref>Green p. 37</ref>) was a leading composer of [[United States|American]] [[Country music|country]], [[Folk music|folk]] and [[gospel music|gospel songs]].He is credited with more than 800 compositions, about a third of which were [[Secular music|nonsacred]].<refname  "McNeil p. 204">McNeil p. 204</ref>

 
Jenkins was born in 1885 in Jenkinsburg, Georgia, on the edge of [[Atlanta]].He was left partially [[blindness|blind]] by a mis-prescribed medication while still an infant.<refname  "Georgia" /><ref>Peterson p. 242-243</ref>

Because he had some vision, Jenkins could not attend the state's school for the blind and had to pursue an education on his own.Besides his musical talents, he was skilled in other ways.After becoming a Methodist at the age of nine, he began "preaching" to playmates from porches and tree stumps.<refname "McNeil p. 205" />

 
Little is known about the Jenkins' musical development over their first three years together, but in 1922, they performed their first program on Atlanta radio station [[WSB (AM)|WSB]] with Andrew Jenkins billed as "the blind newsboy evangelist."<refname  "McNeil p. 205">McNeil p. 205</ref>

The Jenkins Family's initial releases were not originals,<ref>Laird p. 119</ref> but were successful enough to earn the group another session, where they recorded four of Rev. Jenkins's songs, including two gospel numbers.<refname "Wolfe p. 191">Wolfe p. 191</ref> Besides being one of the all-time best-selling country music [[Gramaphone record|78s]],<ref></ref> the song set a sales record for Columbia that stood for many years."The Death of Floyd Collins" was based on one of the first great media events of the century, the story of a spelunker who became trapped in caverns near [[Mammoth Cave]] in Kentucky.<refname "Kenney p. 149" /> The song was one of a series of "event" songs recorded in the mid-20s.The songs told of train wrecks, natural disasters and outlaws, stories often lifted directly from the daily newspapers.The form was not new, and in fact, the music and lyrics owed much to the folk songs of the previous century.The trend did not develop as a natural revival, either.It was devised by the recording companies in response to the drop in sales they were experiencing as the public turned its attention from what had been the latest technological development, records, to an even more alluring medium, radio.<ref>Wolfep. 188-198</ref>

 
Jenkins proved a master at crafting topical songs from traditional musical and lyrical forms.For example, "Floyd Collins" opened with two lines that came directly from an old British ballad:

''Oh, come all you young people''<br />
''and listen while I tell''<br />
''The fate of Floyd Collins,<br />
''a lad we all know well''<ref name="Wolfe p. 191" />

Jenkins was adept at more than just ballads, turning out one song after another, as his stepdaughter Irene described it, like a mill grinding wheat.<refname "McNeil p. 205" />

Although the genre's popularity lasted just one brief year, country artists returned to the form again and again<ref>Peterson p. 31</ref> – in the late 1920s, pioneers such as [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] and the Carter Family and in the 1930s, early folk artists such as [[Woody Guthrie]] and [[Lead Belly]].<ref>Wolfep. 197-198</ref> The genre was revisited during the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s, in particular, by [[Bob Dylan]], who wrote one of his first songs based on the same "formula" used by Jenkins, and [[Phil Ochs]], many of whose songs came directly from newspaper headlines.Meanwhile, Jenkins earned very little from the songs he wrote.<refname "Miller p. 161" />

 
Rev. Jenkins and the Jenkins Family continued to record with Okeh into the mid-1930s under a variety of names, including the Jenkins Sacred Singers, Irene Spain Family, Gooby Jenkins, Andrew Jenkins & [[Carson Robison]] and Jenkins & (Byron) Whitworth.<refname="McNeil p. 205" /> Jenkins cut his last record as an accompanied soloist billed as Blind Andy, a name he often recorded under, on April 23, 1930, while the Jenkins Family's last recording session for Okeh was July 30, 1934.<ref>Russellp. 455-7</ref>

The Jenkins Family's popularity opened Rev. Jenkins's ministry to a wide audience, as they performed at concerts and organized [[revival meeting]]s throughout Georgia.Over time, Jenkins also served as pastor of several churches.In 1939, he lost his eyesight completely, yet continued to preach until the time of his death and also broadcast as an evangelist on Mexico's powerful, uncontrolled radio stations.<refname="Miller p. 161" />

  SENTENCES: '''Terry Waldo''' (born November 26, 1944, Ironton, Ohio) is an American pianist, composer, and historian of early jazz, blues, and [[stride]] music, and is best known for his contribution to the genre of [[ragtime]] and his role in reviving interest in this form, starting in the 1970s.Says [[Wynton Marsalis]] in his introduction to Waldo’s book: “He teaches Ragtime, he talks about Ragtime, he plays it, he embodies it, he lives it, and he keeps Ragtime alive.”<ref>Marsalis "Introduction" ''This Is Ragtime'' xx.</ref>The book, ''This is Ragtime'', published in 1976, grew out of the series of the same title that Waldo produced for NPR in 1974.Waldo is also a theatrical music director, producer, vocalist, and teacher.He is noted for his wit and humor in performance, as “a monologist in the dry, Middle Western tradition.”<ref>Wilson“Waldo Plays Ragtime” ''New York Times'' July 1, 1984.</ref> [[Eubie Blake]] describes his first impression of Waldo’s performance thus: “I died laughing… that’s one of the hardest things to do––make people laugh.Terry’s ability to do this, combined with his musicianship, actually reminds me of [[Fats Waller]].”<ref>Blake "Foreword" ''This is Ragtime'' xxiii.</ref>The Waldo family moved to Columbus, Ohio, when Terry was about five years old.The move was especially serendipitous in that one of the neighbors, John Baker, happened to own a vast collection of jazz recordings, piano rolls and <ref></ref>  and jazz films 

 

In 1963, Waldo began playing with Gene Mayl’s Dixieland Rhythm Kings out of Dayton, Ohio.Mayl’s band was one of a few select hold-outs dotting the country from the traditional jazz revival of the 1940s.The twenty year-old Waldo then appeared in New Orleans in 1964, playing with such notables as Kid Valentine and [[Johnny Wiggs]].The Red Garter, home to various banjo bands, was one of his venues.1965 and 1966 found Waldo in San Francisco playing at another Red Garter, and at Earthquake Mcgoon’s, with West Coast jazz revival musicians.Against the current tide of rock and roll, the young ragtimer played with [[Turk Murphy]]’s Jazz Band, and studied with other prominent jazz musicians such as [[Pops Foster]], [[Lu Watters]], [[Wally Rose]], and [[Clancy Hayes]], all the while living in a room above Mcgoon’s for one dollar per day.Back in Ohio, Waldo pulled together a new band, Waldo's Gutbucket Syncopators, in 1969.This traditional jazz group included players Frank Powers, Roy Tate, and Jim Snyder – among many others – as the group reconvened over time up until recent years.The Syncopators performed at festivals and clubs and have made a number of recordings.This band attracted top musicians from Chicago and New York and featured such notable guest performers as Susan LaMarche, George Rock (of Spike Jones fame), Ruth Brisbane and [[Edith Wilson (singer)]].Waldo went to New York City in the early 1970’s, where he began playing at legendary jazz clubs including The Cookery, [[The Village Gate]], Hanratty's, and The Knickerbocker.Waldo's twenty-six part NPR series, This is Ragtime, aired in 1974 and helped fuel the 1970s ragtime revival.The book of the same title grew out of that series: first published in 1976, and subsequently republished in 1991 and 2009.Eubie Blake, who did the introduction for the book, credits his protégé thus: “Terry’s love of Ragtime goes back a long way, long before its ‘rediscovery.’People then were always trying to talk him out of playing that ‘corny old stuff.’”<ref>Blakexxiv.</ref>Meanwhile, Waldo continued to support the music scene of his native Ohio, forming Waldo’s Ragtime Orchestra in 1980.This group, composed largely of members of Columbus Jazz Arts Group, performed concerts and recorded two albums for [[Stomp Off Records]], which were later reissued by the classical record labels, Musical Heritage Society and Sine Qua Non.In 1984, The Gotham City Jazz Band was born.The band remains active through the present day, having recorded several albums, and headlining regularly at festivals, concerts, and venues in New York City including Michael's Pub, [[Symphony Space]] and [[The Museum of Modern Art]].[[Peter Ecklund]], [[Dan Barrett]], [[Howard Alden]], Eddy Davis, Brian Nalepka, [[Chuck Wilson (jazz musician)|Chuck Wilson]], and Arnie Kinsella, longtime associates, are but a few of the many superlative jazz and ragtime musicians who have been part of the group in its many incarnations over the years.Notable guests of the band include [[Odetta]], [[Leon Redbone]], [[Maurice Hines]], Susan La Marche, and Colleen Hawks.To date, Waldo has produced and arranged more than 40 albums for many labels including [[Sony BMG]], Blackbird Records, [[GHB Records]], Stomp Off Records, Musical Heritage Society, Sine Qua Non, Metronome Records and [[Delmark Records]].Television and film work include performances and compositions on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', the PBS documentary ''Storyville: The Naked Dance'', and [[Ken Burns]]’s PBS documentary, ''[[Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson]]''.Terry has also worked as a composer for a number of his own albums as well as others including Leon Redbone.Terry's TV work has included a year as music director, talent and producer for the experimental and highly publicized two-way television operation, Warner Qube in 1978.His work in New York City theatre includes credits as Music Director for shows such as ''Mr.Jelly Lord'' (directed by Vernel Bagneris), ''Playwrights Horizons''' production of ''Heliotrope Bouquet'' (directed by Joe Morton), ''Ambassador Satch'' (directed by [[André DeShields]]), and ''Warren G'' (directed by [[Tom O'Horgan]]), the Off-Broadway production of ''Shake That Thing!'' and ''Waldo's 1927 Revue''.Terry Waldo’s work as a teacher began in Ohio at [[Denison University]] in the 1970s, with courses in jazz and ragtime history and in film, and continues to the present day with ragtime courses for Swing University for [[Jazz at Lincoln Center]] in 2009, and a course in early jazz piano styles in 2010.Waldo’s range of expertise (composing, arranging, writing, directing, and performing) has been evidenced across a wide spectrum of media and performing arts, as well as in his several one-man shows: ''Eubie and Me'', and ''The Naked Dance: The Music of Storyville''.He continues to produce his own shows and recordings along with his partner, Janice Lee, through Waldo/Lee Music Productions, Inc. Waldo/Lee recently provided production assistance for the latest revised edition of Waldo's book, ''This Is Ragtime'' for [[Jazz at Lincoln Center]] Library Editions, as well as reissuing the radio series of the same title made for [[NPR]].The company is now developing a new Off-Broadway musical show for Waldo.Meanwhile, he continues a series of live performances in diverse venues including The Supreme Court, The Smithsonian Institute, The Kennedy Center, Carnegie Hall<ref></ref> (as a featured guest with the New York Pops) and The National Gallery of Arts in Washington.Waldo, Terry.''This is Ragtime.''New York: Jazz at Lincoln Center Library Editions, 2009.<!--- See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->

  TARGET: http://dbpedia.org/resource/Banjo
  SENTENCES: '''Lauren O'Connell''' is a [[singer/songwriter]] from [[Rochester, New York]].She has released two full length solo albums and one EP as a duo with [[Nataly Dawn]].She began uploading videos of herself performing original songs on [[YouTube]] soon after releasing her debut album ''Sitting in Chairs''.Her first videos were simple one takes with just a guitar, but they soon progressed to layered harmonies and accompaniment, usually with O'Connell playing all of the instruments herself.Many of her fans cite her appearances in videos with other YouTube artists, mainly those with best friend [[Julia Nunes]], as what first drew them to her music.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>O'Connell's music career began after coming across her father's old guitar in the basement one day when she was thirteen.After learning a few chords from her dad and messing around with the guitar for a while, she got serious about playing and began taking lessons, writing her first song by the age of fifteen.<ref></ref>After spending some time playing coffeehouse shows, in 2007 O'Connell went to Saxon Recording in Rochester, New York at the suggestion of a friend and recorded her debut album ''Sitting In Chairs''.She recorded the entire album acoustic in one day.<ref></ref>Shortly after releasing ''Sitting In Chairs'' O'Connell began attending [[Binghamton University]].<ref></ref><ref></ref>Throughout her freshman year she continued to write and perform.She performed many shows with her best friend Julia Nunes.In late 2008 she decided to leave school and pursue music full time.She then began recording her follow up album ''The Shakes'', which was released in early 2009.During the summer of 2009 O'Connell met [[Jack Conte]] and Nataly Dawn of [[Pomplamoose]] when they came to New York to produce Nunes' ''I Think You Know'' EP.After deciding that she wanted a change of scenery in early 2010, O'Connell moved to [[Rohnert Park, California]] where she moved in with Conte and Dawn.<ref></ref>A few months after moving to California she and Dawn began a collaboration called My Terrible Friend.<ref></ref>The duo recorded an EP titled ''Room for Ghosts'' in their home studio and released it through [[iTunes]] and their [[Myspace]] page on July 7, 2010.<ref></ref><ref></ref>On July 20, 2010 O'Connell and Dawn were featured on the YouTube homepage for Music Tuesday, both individually and as My Terrible Friend.Though O'Connell's fanbase was initially centered around the local area where she performed, the use of social media such as Myspace and YouTube videos exposed her music to a much wider audience.Through these sites she has gained fans in many countries and, as evidenced by the comments on her Myspace page and YouTube channel, given them a forum to request shows throughout America and in their respective countries.Although most of her shows have been in America, she has played a few outside of the country.In April 2009 she was scheduled to play two free shows in London, but was detained by Customs and forced to cancel them.Customs agents allowed her to leave and stay the night with a friend, but deported her the next day.<ref></ref><ref></ref>On November 8, 2009 she played with Pomplamoose at the wedding of [[Take That]] member [[Mark Owen]] and English actress [[Emma Ferguson]] in Cawdor Church, Scotland.<ref></ref><ref></ref>Ferguson, a fan of [[Rufus Wainwright]], discovered Nataly Dawn's cover of Wainwright's song "Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk" and invited Dawn to play the song at the wedding.She then discovered Pomplamoose and O'Connell and Dawn's "The Daylight Here" and invited Jack Conte and O'Connell to play as well.On September 3, 2010 O'Connell, Dawn, and Julia Nunes played a free show for students of [[Dawson College]] at the Le National Bar in Montreal.The show was hosted by the Dawson Student Union.Each played solo sets and in various combinations.It was O'Connell and Dawn's first performance as My Terrible Friend.<ref></ref>In September 2010 O'Connell was chosen as the West Regional Winner of the 2010 [[Mountain Stage]] Newsong Contest.On October 22, 2010 she joined eleven other finalists from across America and Canada at Arts World Financial Center's Wintergarden in New York City for the Award Round performance competition and an opportunity to record an EP with [[Grammy]] winning producer [[Jacquire King]].<ref></ref><ref></ref>On December 14, 2010 O'Connell announced that she was raising money to record a new album and was working with [[Pledgemusic]] in order to give fans an opportunity to help fund studio time, with the goal of being in the studio sometime in January 2011.In return for pledging O'Connell decided to include personalized merchandise ranging from autographed cds and t-shirts, handwritten lyrics, and hand-drawn artwork to house concerts, her personal iPod filled with music, and even grocery shopping or mini-golf with the pledger when she comes to their city for a show.<ref></ref>The project was set for a sixty day pledge period, however fan pledges exceeded the target amount in the first 24 hours, making it the fastest Pledgemusic project ever to reach it's goal.One week later she added more of the incentives that sold out quickly as well as new incentives like the harmonicas she uses for her videos and albums, a Photoshop vacation photo with the pledger, and a volleyball painted with the pledger's face in the style of "Wilson" from the movie [[Cast Away]], joking that her New Year's resolution was to make progressively weirder arts and crafts.<ref></ref>The project raised 268% of the original goal by the time it concluded on February 14, 2011.<ref></ref>O'Connell's debut album was recorded at Saxon Recording in Rochester, New York in early 2007.''Sitting In Chairs'' was recorded in just one day, single-tracked with an acoustic guitar.<ref></ref>'''Track List'''

For much of his career, Blind Blake was based at the Royal Victoria Hotel in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]].Included in his wide repertoire was "Love, Love Alone," a song (by Trinidadian calypsonian Caresser) about the abdication of Edward VIII.Blind Blake's version of this calypso is said to have been enjoyed by the former king himself, who, as the Duke of Windsor, served as Governor of the Bahamas during World War II.Higgs played banjo and sang, releasing 4 albums during his tenure at the Royal Victoria Hotel, one with singer Lou Adams, and several other lesser albums towards the end of his career.His first 4 albums were released on Floridian label Art, including a 10" with Lou Adams.Although never famous in his own right, sadly, his music has been covered by the likes of [[Dave Van Ronk]] (Yes, Yes,Yes) [[Pete Seeger]] (Foolish frog), [[Lord Mouse and the Kalypso Katz]] (Tomatoes), and the Percentie Brothers, (Goombay Drums).His style was a mix of dixieland jazz, calypso/goombay, and American folk, probably because of the close proximity the Bahamas has to the USA.For Several decades, he was arguably the most important figure in the Bahamian tourist entertainment industry.One of his most famous songs, the medley "Little Nassau/Peas and Rice," written during the US prohibition era, is about the easy access to alcoholic beverages in Nassau, then complaining of the local's frustration with a diet of peas and rice.[[Johnny Cash]] based his hit "Delia" on an old blues [[ballad]] from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] that Higgs had adapted into a [[calypso music|calypso]].[[Category:1915 births]]

  SENTENCES: '''Aleksandar Živojinović''', [[Order of Canada|OC]], (born August 27, 1953) better known by his stage name '''Alex Lifeson''', is a second generation [[Serbian-Canadian]] musician, best known as the [[guitarist]] of the Canadian [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Rush (band)|Rush]].In the summer of 1968, Lifeson founded the band that would become Rush with friend, drummer [[John Rutsey]].He has been an integral member of the band ever since.For Rush, Lifeson plays electric and acoustic guitars as well as other [[stringed instruments]] such as [[mandola]], [[mandolin]], and [[bouzouki]].He also performs backing vocals in live performances, and occasionally plays keyboards and bass pedal synthesizers.During live performances, Lifeson, like the other members of Rush, performs real-time triggering of [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampled]] instruments, concurrently with his guitar playing.<refname="onstagemag.com">[http://www.onstagemag.com/ar/performance_rush_rolls_again/index.htm"Rush Rolls Again", September 2002, OnStage Magazine]</ref>
The bulk of Lifeson's work in music has been with Rush, although Lifeson has contributed to a body of work outside of the band as well.Aside from music, Lifeson is part owner of the Toronto restaurant [[The Orbit Room]], and is a licensed aircraft [[Aviator|pilot]].<refname = "vdtsgn"></ref>

Along with his bandmates [[Geddy Lee]] and [[Neil Peart]], Lifeson was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] on May 9, 1996.The trio was the first rock band to be so honoured, as a group.<ref>[http://www.maplemusic.com/artists/rus/bio.asp "Rush highlights"], [[MapleMusic]] (accessed May 23, 2007).</ref>Lifeson was born Aleksandar Živojinović in [[Fernie, British Columbia|Fernie]], British Columbia to [[Serb]]ian immigrants, Nenad and Melanija Zivojinovich (from [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: Живојиновић, ''Živojinović''), and raised in [[Toronto]], Ontario.<refname  cohen></ref> In 1963 Lifeson met future Rush drummer [[John Rutsey]] in school.Both interested in music, they decided to form a band.Lifeson was primarily a self-taught guitarist with the only formal instruction coming from a high school friend in 1971 who taught classical guitar lessons.This training lasted for roughly a year and a half.Lifeson recalls what inspired him to play guitar in a 2008 interview:



Lifeson's first girlfriend, Charlene, gave birth to their eldest son, Justin, in October 1970, and they married in 1975.Their second son, Adrian, who is also involved in music, performed on two tracks from Lifeson's 1996 solo project, ''Victor''.[[Image:20110527-200145 Rush Ahoy Rotterdam 1200x0800.jpg|right|thumb|240px|AlexLifeson during the 2010–2011 [[Time Machine Tour]], Ahoy, Rotterdam, The Netherlands (May 27., 2011)]]
Lifeson's neighbour [[John Rutsey]] began experimenting on a rented drum kit and, in early 1968, Lifeson and Rutsey formed The Projection, which eventually became Rush following the recruitment of original bassist/vocalist [[Jeff Jones (musician)|Jeff Jones]].[[Geddy Lee]] assumed this role soon after.<ref></ref>Instrumentally, Lifeson is regarded as a guitarist whose strengths and notability rely primarily on signature riffing, electronic effects and processing, unorthodox chord structures, and a copious arsenal of equipment used over the years.<ref>AlexLifeson profile [http://www.dinosaurrockguitar.com/bios/Lifeson.shtmlDinosaur Rock God] Accessed March 31, 2006</ref><ref>Alex Lifeson minor overview [http://www.guitarplayer.com/story.asp?storycode 11:ghdayl7jxpnb~T1 All Classical] Accessed March 31, 2006</ref>

Rush was on hiatus for several years starting in 1997 owing to personal tragedies in Neil Peart's life, and Lifeson had not picked up a guitar for at least a year following those events.<refname Hammond/>

From 1980 to 1986, Lifeson used four identically modified Stratocasters, all of them equipped with the Floyd Rose bridge.As a joke, he called these Hentor Sportscasters – a made-up name inspired by Peter Henderson's name, who was the producer of ''[[Grace Under Pressure (Rush album)|Grace Under Pressure]]''.<ref>[http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/GUPtourbook.htmGrace Under Pressure Tourbook]</ref> He also played a Gibson Howard Roberts Fusion.<refname cohen/>

In 2005, Hughes & Kettner introduced an Alex Lifeson signature series amplifier 

 
In addition to traditional stringed instruments such as acoustic and electric guitars, Lifeson has also played [[mandola]], [[mandolin]] and [[bouzouki]] on recent Rush studio albums, including ''[[Test for Echo]]'', ''[[Vapor Trails]]'' and ''[[Snakes & Arrows]]''.During live Rush performances, Lifeson uses a [[MIDI controller]] that enables him to use his feet to trigger sounds from [[sampler (musical instrument)|digital samplers]], without taking his hands off his guitar.(Prior to this, Lifeson used [[Moog Taurus]] Bass Pedals before they were replaced by Korg MIDI pedals in the 1980s.)Lifeson and his bandmates share a desire to accurately depict songs from their albums when playing live performances.Toward this goal, beginning in the late 1980s the band equipped their live performances with a capacious rack of samplers.The band members use these samplers in real-time to recreate the sounds of non-traditional instruments, [[accompaniment]]s, vocal [[harmonies]], and other sound "events" that are familiarly heard on the studio versions of the songs.In live performances, the band members share duties throughout most songs, with each member triggering certain sounds with his available limbs, while playing his primary instrument(s).<refname="onstagemag.com"/>

  SENTENCES: '''Lindsey Adams Buckingham''' (born October 3, 1949) is an American guitarist, singer, composer and producer, most notable for being the guitarist and male lead singer of the musical group [[Fleetwood Mac]].Aside from his tenure with Fleetwood Mac, Buckingham has also released six solo albums and a live album.As a member of Fleetwood Mac, he was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1998.Born in [[Palo Alto, California]], Buckingham was the third and youngest child of Rutheda (née Elliott) and Morris Buckingham.He had two older brothers, Jeff and Greg.Growing up in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] community of [[Atherton, California|Atherton]], Buckingham and his brothers were encouraged to swim competitively.Though Buckingham dropped out of athletics to pursue music, his brother [[Greg Buckingham|Greg]] went on to win a [[silver medal]] at the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]].Buckingham's first forays into guitar playing took place on a toy Mickey Mouse guitar, playing along to his brother Jeff's extensive collection of 45s.Noticing his talent, Buckingham's parents bought their son a $35 Harmony guitar.Buckingham never took guitar lessons and does not read music.<ref>[http://www.fleetwoodmac.org/lindsey-buckingham.php]</ref>By age 13, he became interested in [[folk music]] and, influenced by banjo methods, practiced the energetic style of The Kingston Trio.At 15 he joined a small folk group, Fritz, providing vocals and guitar work.Buckingham and his then-girlfriend [[Stevie Nicks]] recorded seven [[Demo (music)|demo]]s in 1972 on an [[analog (signal)|analog]] 4-track machine, and drove to [[Los Angeles]] to pursue a record deal.In 1973, [[Polydor Records]] signed the pair.Their album, ''[[Buckingham Nicks]]'', was released in September 1973 
 
Despite Polydor's measure, though, ''Buckingham Nicks'' has been championed by rock critics since its release.It features fine two-part harmonies backed by notable LA session musicians, including superstar drummer [[Jim Keltner]].According to the album notes, other session musicians include: Ron Tutt (Elvis Presley TCB Band), drums 

Although money was tight, the hardworking duo caught the attention of many budding musicians, including [[Warren Zevon]], who is rumored to have been a roommate of Nicks and Buckingham in a Fairfax district apartment.A short tour promoting the ''Buckingham Nicks'' album commenced shortly after the joining of Buckingham and Nicks with Fleetwood Mac.Bootlegs of two concerts in Mobile and Tuscaloosa exist and are widely distributed on peer-to-peer networks and fansites.The touring band included drummers Bob Aguirre (from Fritz) and Gary Hodges playing simultaneously and bassist [[Tom Moncrieff]], who later played bass on Stevie Nicks' 1981 album ''Bella Donna''.To help make ends meet, Buckingham toured with Don Everly's back-up band, singing Phil Everly's parts.<ref></ref>Buckingham and Nicks were eventually forced to move in with record producer [[Keith Olsen]], who helped the pair work on several demos for the next Buckingham Nicks album, including "I'm So Afraid", "Monday Morning" and "Rhiannon".''Buckingham Nicks'' has never been released on CD (a bootleg version does exist), although both Buckingham and Nicks have hinted at a possible remix and re-release on CD in the near future.Buckingham has also suggested a tour in support of the collection could be something the two may be interested in.Moncrieff and Hodges from the original Buckingham Nicks touring band have also expressed interest.While checking out the Sound City recording studio in California, [[Mick Fleetwood]] heard the song "Frozen Love" from the ''Buckingham Nicks'' album.He asked who the guitarist was, and immediately stated that he wanted him to fill a recent vacancy.Buckingham insisted to Fleetwood that he and Nicks were a package deal—if Fleetwood didn't want Nicks, he wouldn't get Buckingham.The duo was quickly asked to join Fleetwood Mac on New Year's Eve, 1974.Fleetwood Mac released their [[Fleetwood Mac (1975 album)|eponymously titled album]] in 1975, which became a hit.However it was the second album of this new line-up, ''[[Rumours]]'', that propelled the band to superstar status when it became one of the best-selling albums of all time.Buckingham's "[[Go Your Own Way]]" was the lead-off single, soaring into the US Top Ten.After the resounding commercial success of ''Rumours'' (during the making of which Buckingham and Nicks famously split), Buckingham was determined to avoid falling into repeating the same musical pattern.The result was ''[[Tusk (album)|Tusk]]'' (1979), a double album that Buckingham primarily directed.Once again, Buckingham wrote the lead-off single, the title track that would peak at #8 on Billboard's Hot 100.It was during this time that Buckingham moved in with record company secretary and aspiring model, Carol Ann Harris, with whom he lived until 1984.Though by most standards a hit, ''Tusk'' failed to come close to ''Rumours'' record sales, and the album was followed by a hiatus in the band's studio recording efforts.After a large world tour that ended in 1980, Fleetwood Mac took a year-long break before reconvening to record their next album ''[[Mirage (Fleetwood Mac album)|Mirage]]'', a more pop-friendly work that returned the band to the top of the US album chart.However, by this time various members of the band were enjoying success as solo artists (particularly Nicks) and it would be five years before the release of the next Fleetwood Mac album.By the time ''[[Tango in the Night]]'' was released in 1987, Buckingham had already released two solo albums and had given up much of the material for what would have been his third solo album for the project, including "[[Big Love (Fleetwood Mac song)|Big Love]]", "Tango in the Night", "Family Man", "You and I" and "Caroline".On several of these tracks Buckingham played every instrument ."Big Love", released as the first single from the album, became a top ten hit in the US and the UK.Propelled by a string of hit singles, ''Tango in the Night'' became the band's biggest album since ''Rumours'' a decade earlier.However, following its release, Buckingham left Fleetwood Mac<ref>"Fleetwood: My Life and Adventures with Fleetwood Mac" by Mick Fleetwood and Stephen Davis</ref> largely because of his desire not to tour and the strain he was feeling within the band.Fleetwood Mac continued without him, and Buckingham was replaced by guitarists [[Rick Vito]] and [[Billy Burnette]].During the time he worked on ''Tusk'', Buckingham also produced albums for [[Walter Egan]] and [[John Stewart (folk musician)|John Stewart]] in the late 1970s as well as beginning work on his own solo album.In 1981, Buckingham released his first solo album ''[[Law and Order (album)|Law and Order]]'', playing nearly every instrument and featuring guest appearances by bandmates Mick Fleetwood and Christine McVie.The album pursued the quirky, eclectic, often lo-fi and new-wave-influences of ''Tusk'', and spawned the hit single ''[[Trouble (Lindsey Buckingham song)|Trouble]]'' which reached #9 on the US Charts and #1 in Australia (for three weeks).Two years later, he wrote and performed the songs "[[Holiday Road]]" and "Dancin' Across the U.S.A." for the film ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]''."Holiday Road" was released as a single, and reached #82 on the ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]].He did other soundtrack work, including the song "Time Bomb Town" from ''[[Back to the Future]]'' (1985).In 1984, after ending his 7-year relationship with Carol Ann Harris, he released his second solo album, ''[[Go Insane (album)|Go Insane]]''.The title track was a modest hit, reaching #23 on the Hot 100.The last track of the album, D.W. Suite, was a tribute to the late [[Beach Boys]] drummer [[Dennis Wilson]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070922054215/http://www.madnessfades.net/DWSuite.htmMadness Fades - Lindsey Buckingham, In His Words]</ref> The next year, Buckingham performed on [[USA for Africa]]'s fundraising single, "[[We Are the World]]".Following his split with Fleetwood Mac in 1987, Buckingham spent much of the next five years in the studio, working on his third solo album, ''[[Out of the Cradle]]'', which was released in 1992.Many of the songs seem to deal with the death of his father and the sudden death of his brother Greg in 1990."Wrong" was a gentle rebuke of former bandmate Mick Fleetwood's tell-all biography.''Out of the Cradle'' received some favorable reviews but did not achieve the sales levels associated with Fleetwood Mac.However, Buckingham toured throughout 1992–93 for the first time as a solo artist 

A subsequent solo album, entitled ''[[Gift of Screws]]'', was recorded between 1995–2001 and presented to Warner Bros./Reprise for release.Executives at the label managed to persuade Buckingham to hold the album back and instead take several tracks from ''Gift of Screws'' and re-record them with Fleetwood Mac.Thus, seven songs from ''Gift of Screws'' appear on the Fleetwood Mac album ''[[Say You Will]]'', in substantially the same form as Buckingham had recorded them for his solo release.Excellent bootleg copies of ''Gift of Screws''—taken from an original CD-R presented to Warner Bros/Reprise—are known to exist, and have been widely distributed among fans through the use of [[BitTorrent (protocol)|torrent]] sites and other [[peer-to-peer networks]].On his 57th birthday, (October 3, 2006) Buckingham's fourth solo album, an acoustic album entitled ''[[Under the Skin (album)|Under the Skin]]'' was released.''Under The Skin'' features Buckingham on almost all instruments, with the exception of two tracks that feature Fleetwood Mac's rhythm section of [[John McVie]] and Mick Fleetwood.The album includes a cover of [[The Rolling Stones]] classic "[[Aftermath (The Rolling Stones album)|I Am Waiting]]".Three days after the album's release, Buckingham embarked on a tour in support the album that lasted until the end of June 2007.<ref>[http://www.fmlegacy.com/concertslb2006.htmlThe 2006-2007 Lindsey Shows]</ref> A live album and DVD, ''Live at the Bass Performance Hall'', was released documenting the Fort Worth, Texas show from this tour.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS210678+05-Feb-2008+MW20080205Reuters Press Release]</ref> 

In 2008, the ''[[Gift of Screws]]'' album was finally released, containing three tracks from the originally planned album, as well as seven new recordings.Buckingham then commenced a short tour to promote ''Gift of Screws'' in September and October, opening in [[Saratoga, California]] and closing in [[New York, New York]].<ref>[http://www.fleetwoodmac-uk.com/albums/giftofscrews/giftofscrews-tour.htmlThe 2008 Lindsey Shows]</ref>

On November 3, 2010 it was announced on Buckingham's website that he is currently working on an untitled album for release in early 2011.<ref>[http://www.lindseybuckingham.com/]</ref>As of April 2011, Buckingham had finished recording the album, titled ''[[Seeds We Sow]]'', and it was released on September 6, 2011.On April 22, 2011, a concert of Buckingham's was filmed for a DVD release to support the forthcoming album.<ref></ref>In 1992, newly elected president [[Bill Clinton]] asked Fleetwood Mac to come together to perform the song he had chosen for his campaign, "[[Don't Stop (Fleetwood Mac song)|Don't Stop]]", at his inaugural ceremony.Buckingham agreed to be part of the performance, but the experience was something of a one-off for the band, who were still very much at odds with one another and had no plans to reunite officially.While assembling material for a planned fourth solo album in the mid 1990s, Buckingham contacted Mick Fleetwood for assistance on a song.Their collaboration lasted much longer than anticipated, and the two eventually decided to call upon Stevie Nicks, John and Christine McVie.The band's old chemistry was clearly still there, and plans for a reunion tour were soon in the works.In 1997, Buckingham and all four of his bandmates from the original ''Rumours'' line-up of Fleetwood Mac went on the road for the first time together since 1982 in a reunion tour titled ''[[The Dance (album)|The Dance]]''.The tour was hugely successful and did much to heal the damage that had been done between Buckingham and his bandmates.However, Christine McVie had opted to leave the band in 1998, essentially now making the band a foursome.In 2003, the reformed band released the first studio album involving Buckingham and Nicks in 15 years, ''Say You Will''.Buckingham's song "Peacekeeper" was the first single from the album, and the band went on a world concert tour that would last almost a year and a half.The band toured in 2009, rehearsals began in January 2009, with the first date of the "UNLEASHED" Tour as March 1, 2009, in [[Mellon Arena]] ([[Pittsburgh]]).Christine McVie was not involved with this project.Unlike most rock guitarists, Buckingham does not play with a [[plectrum|pick]] 

His influences include The Beach Boys and [[The Kingston Trio]].In an interview with ''[[Acoustic Guitar (magazine)|Acoustic Guitar Magazine]]'', Buckingham said:

''"I've always believed that you play to highlight the song, not to highlight the player.The song is all that matters.There are two ways you can choose to go.You can try to be someone like [[Eddie Van Halen]], who is a great guitar player, a virtuoso.Yet he doesn't make good records because what he plays is totally lost in the context of this band's music.''Then there are guitar players like [[Chet Atkins]], who weren't out there trying to show themselves off as guitar players per se, but were using the guitar as a tool to make good records.I remember loving Chet's work when I was a kid, but it was only later, when I really listened to his guitar parts, that I realized how much they were a part of the song's fabric, and how much you'd be going 'Oh, that song just isn't working' if they weren't there."On July 8, 1998, Buckingham's girlfriend, Kristen Messner, gave birth to their son, William Gregory Buckingham.Buckingham and Messner subsequently married in 2000, and she gave birth to a daughter, Leelee, the same year.Their third child, Stella, was born on April 20, 2004.The song "It Was You" from his ''Under the Skin'' album pays homage to all three children by using their names.Lindsey Buckingham has been portrayed by [[Bill Hader]] in a recurring sketch titled "[[What Up With That]]" on NBC's ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.He appeared as himself on the May 14, 2011, episode during this sketch.'''Albums'''

but was raised in [[El Sobrante, California]] in a working class family with a history of working as auto mechanics.A close family friend, Rhys Hickman, taught him the basics of the [[slap bass]] technique, which he mastered throughout his educational period.His early education included Collins Elementary School and [[De Anza High School]], where he was a personal friend of [[Kirk Hammett]].In 1986, after the death of [[Metallica]] bassist [[Cliff Burton]], school friend Kirk Hammett encouraged Claypool to audition for Metallica as Burton's successor.In Metallica's ''[[Behind the Music]]'', Claypool said that he jokingly asked the others if they wanted to "jam on some [[Isley Brothers]] tunes" during the audition, a reference to his little experience of the [[thrash metal]] scene.[[James Hetfield]] remarked that Claypool was not awarded the job because "he was too good" and "should do his own thing".Claypool would later admit that he wouldn't have fit in with the band and "would've looked like a freak".The bass slot was instead given to [[Jason Newsted]], who played with Metallica until his departure in 2001.For several years before forming Primus, Claypool worked as a carpenter in El Sobrante.Claypool has cited [[Larry Graham]], [[Chris Squire]], [[Tony Levin]], [[Geddy Lee]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[Geezer Butler]], [[Bootsy Collins]], [[Stanley Clarke]], [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] as his musical influences [http://www.allmusic.com/artist/les-claypool-p64967].[[Primus (band)|Primus]] began as Primate with Les Claypool, guitarist [[Todd Huth]] and various drummers, most notably [[Jay Lane]], in the mid-1980s, though Huth and Lane left shortly thereafter to pursue other projects.Claypool replaced them with guitarist [[Larry LaLonde]] and drummer [[Tim Alexander]] in 1989 (Tim "Herb" Alexander left the band in 1996 and was replaced by [[Brian Mantia|Brian "Brain" Mantia]]).From 1989 to 2000, Primus steadily became one of the most bizarre bands to gain significant mainstream airplay, headlining [[Lollapalooza]] in 1993, appearing on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' and ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' in 1995, and even making an appearance at [[Woodstock '94]] where they performed their ''[[Pork Soda]]'' hit "[[My Name Is Mud]]" and were pelted with mud (Claypool claims to still have mud in his speakers).In 1991, the band was featured in the cult classic movie ''[[Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey]]'', performing ,"[[Tommy the Cat]]" live.Also, in 1997, they were asked to play, and record, the theme song for the animated television show ''[[South Park]]''.Claypool and [[Tom Waits]] have recorded on each other's records since 1991 and have continued to do so.In 1999, he let Activision use the song "[[Jerry Was a Race Car Driver]]" on the hit video game ''[[Tony Hawk's Pro Skater]]''.In 2000, Primus went on indefinite hiatus.In mid 2003, Claypool reunited with former Primus drummer [[Tim Alexander]] and guitarist [[Ler LaLonde]] to record a DVD/EP called ''[[Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People]]'', which Claypool described as the first DVD with supplementary music, as opposed to the contrary.In October of that year, the band staged a two month tour in which they performed two sets per show, the second consisting of their 1991 release ''[[Sailing the Seas of Cheese]]'' in its entirety.They continued touring into 2004, now performing their 1990 release ''[[Frizzle Fry]]'' as the second set, as documented on the DVD ''[[Hallucino-Genetics]]: Live 2004''.In Mid-August 2006, a DVD release entitled ''Blame It on the Fish'' was added to the listings of Amazon and other online shops.Shortly thereafter, the website ''The PRP'' reported that a rumor had surfaced implying that the band was quietly planning a North American tour for November/December 2006.<ref></ref>On October 17, 2006, Primus released both their first greatest hits CD ''[[They Can't All Be Zingers]]'' and their third DVD ''[[Blame It on The Fish (DVD)|Blame It on The Fish]],'' subtitled ''An Abstract Look at the 2003 Primus Tour De Fromage.''[[Image:Claypool to wiki.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Playing a Bayou 4 bass with Primus at the [[Open'er Festival]] 2011 in [[Gdynia]], [[Poland]].]]''They Can't All Be Zingers'' includes sixteen digitally remastered songs that span their entire career, including a previously unreleased and extended version of "[[Shake Hands with Beef]]", the [[Tom Waits]] collaboration "Coattails of a Deadman," and "Mary the Ice Cube" from the 2003 DVD and EP ''[[Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People]].''''Blame It on the Fish: An Abstract Look at the 2003 Primus Tour De Fromage'' contains live footage from the band's 2003 reunion tour, interview segments and behind the scenes footage.The DVD includes a 70 minute feature film and 90 minutes of bonus material, including a 30 minute [[mockumentary]] about the band in 2065.''Blame It on the Fish'' is directed by [[Matthew J. Powers]], who directed ''Never Been Done'', a documentary about [[Jon Comer]].Claypool has let the video game ''[[Guitar Hero 2]]'' use the Primus song, "John the Fisherman," one of two songs in the game using the original recording instead of a cover.[[Primus: The Beat a Dead Horse Tour 2006]] began in November 2006 and was completed the following December.In 2008 Primus played at a few festivals including 

 
 
 
In 1994, Claypool teamed up with guitarist Todd Huth and drummer Jay Lane to create an early Primus sound.Songs such as "Riddles are Abound Tonight" and "Toyz 1988" (now known as "Toys Go Winding Down") gave way to a whole new breed of music.In 1996 Claypool produced, engineered and released a solo album, "Les Claypool and the Holy Mackerel presents" ''[[Highball with the Devil]]''.Claypool is credited with bass, drums and vocals on several tracks as well as guitar.Also on the album are [[M.I.R.V.|Mark "Mirv" Haggard]], [[Adam Gates]], [[Jay Lane]], Joe Gore, [[Charlie Hunter]] and [[Henry Rollins]].The accompanying tour included Haggard and Gates on guitars with [[Bryan "Brain" Mantia]] on drums.It was announced during the Holy Mackerel tour that Mantia had been chosen to become the next Primus drummer.In April 2000, Claypool collaborated with [[Trey Anastasio]] (of [[Phish]]) and [[Stewart Copeland]] (of [[The Police]]) as [[Oysterhead]].Claypool and Anastasio had been looking for an opportunity to collaborate.Each had a mutual interest in playing with Copeland who had been a rock idol of their teen years.Also, Claypool and Copeland had an established friendship.Oysterhead were originally intended as a one time performance during [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival|Jazz Fest]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]].Though timid of the band's sudden and surprising popularity they eventually decided to record and tour.<refname 859 FROGS & OYSTERS: A LES CLAYPOOL INTERVIEW] Mike Powers, ''jambase.com'',1/26/01, Retrieved January 26, 2008</ref> They released one studio album, ''[[The Grand Pecking Order]]'', and toured before disbanding in 2001.They re-united  in 2006, at the [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]]

 

In May 2000 Claypool formed [[Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade]], an experimental rock group.Claypool was asked to put together a band for the Mountain Aire Festival in [[Angels Camp, California]].The band "of the most incredible guys (he) could possibly find" debuted that Memorial Day weekend and played a number of other festivals including [[moe.#moe.down|moe.down]].<refname "frogs&oysters" /></blockquote>

The Primus hiatus allowed him to return to his musical roots, playing songs by bands such as [[Pink Floyd]], [[King Crimson]], and [[The Beatles]].Claypool has called the Frog Brigade his "[[mid-life crisis]] band."From a set of October shows recorded at The [[Great American Music Hall]] in San Francisco Claypool released two Frog Brigade live albums, one being a cover of [[Pink Floyd|Pink Floyd's]] ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]''.The line-up included [[Todd Huth]], [[Eenor]], [[Jeff Chimenti]], [[Jay Lane]], [[Skerik]] and Claypool.The Frog Brigade is also noted for Claypool's being accepted into the [[jam band]] scene.<ref>''Jambands'',Dean Budnick, Backbeat Books, 2003, pp 248-9</ref> ''[[Live Frogs Set 1]]'' won "Best Live Album" at the second annual [[Jammys]].Jay Lane and Jeff Chimenti are both members of [[Bob Weir]]'s band [[Ratdog]].Claypool performed with "The Rat Brigade" when opening for Ratdog once in 2000 and again in 2007.The Rat Brigade includes Claypool, drummer Lane and keyboardist Chimenti, with guest appearances by saxophonist Kenny Brooks and Bob Weir.Both years Claypool also guested on the Ratdog set.In 2002 Claypool released a studio album of the Frog Brigade, ''[[Purple Onion]]''.Musicians on multiple tracks for ''Purple Onion'' include [[Eenor]], [[Mike Dillon (musician)|Mike Dillon]], [[Skerik]], [[Jay Lane]], Ben Barnes and [[Sam Bass]] (Dillon and Skerik were both from [[Critters Buggin]] while Barnes and Sam Bass were from [[Deadweight (U.S. band)|Deadweight]]).This album includes "Whamola" which later appeared as a remix for the theme of [[South Park]] [[List_of_South_Park_episodes#Season_10:_2006|Season 10]].Also in 2002 Claypool collaborated with virtuoso guitarist [[Buckethead]], [[Parliament-Funkadelic]]/[[Talking Heads]] keyboardist [[Bernie Worrell]], and former [[Primus (band)|Primus]] drummer [[Bryan Mantia]] under the name [[Colonel Claypool's Bucket of Bernie Brains]] ("C2B3" which is to be said "C Squared, B Cubed").Their concerts pushed the improvisational envelope by preparing no material and not rehearsing beforehand.At one of their shows they prepared sandwiches onstage for the audience to eat.C2B3 re-united in 2004 to record ''[[The Big Eyeball in the Sky]]'', an album with equal parts instrumental and vocal songs.The band began an 18-state [http://www.c2b3.com/tour/tour] of the [[United States|US]] on September 24, 2004.The album features only one guest, the child-like multi-instrumentalist [[Gabby La La]] (noted as Gabby Lang on [[Les Claypool's Frog Brigade]]'s [[Purple Onion]]) on vocals and sitar.She also opened on every show (sometimes to scathingly negative reviews) during the 2004 tour as a solo act with sometimes members of C2B3.Claypool also [[Record producer|produced]] and performed on [[Gabby La La]]'s first album, ''[[Be Careful What You Wish For...]]''.Gabby La La is the first artist Les has signed to his label since [[Charlie Hunter]] in 1993.He has performed select shows with her (including the 2005 [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]]) and added her to his then new touring band, [[Les Claypool's Fancy Band|Les Claypool & His Fancy Band]].The 2005 Fancy Band line-up also included [[Skerik]], [[Mike Dillon (musician)|Dillon]] and [[Jay Lane|Lane]].At the end of 2005, Claypool released ''[[5 Gallons Of Diesel]]'', a video retrospective of all of his work away from Primus.Claypool's first attempt at a feature length film, ''[[Electric Apricot: Quest For Festeroo]]'', was shown on various film festivals in the late spring of 2006.The movie is a spoof of the jam band scene centered on the fake band, Electric Apricot, in the mockumentary tradition of ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]''.<refname 0 "Les Claypool: The Art of Falling"].''JamBase''.2006.Retrieved February 2, 2008.</ref>The group performed low-key shows in the [[California]] area (most recently [[High Sierra Music Festival]]) for the filming of the movie.The members of the band are characterized as Steve Hampton "Aiwass" Trouzdale (Adam Gates) on bass and vocals, Steve "Gordo" Gordon (Brian Kehoe) on guitar and vocals, Herschal Tambor Brillstien (Jonathan Korty) on keyboards and vocals, and of course Lapland "Lapdog" Miclovik (Les Claypool) on drums and vocals.The film debuted on March 15.During a question and answer session at the Tiburon Film Festival where the film debuted Claypool said that the yet unreleased DVD would have an accompanying soundtrack CD.The film has won other awards as well including Best Feature (audience choice) at the [[Malibu, California#Arts and culture|Malibu Film Festival]].Claypool also said that the band would possibly perform a few select shows, but a tour is unlikely as Adam Gates has a job at [[Pixar]] which makes touring difficult.Other cameos in the film include [[Arj Barker]], [[Dian Bachar]], [[Seth Green]], [[Matt Stone]] and [[Sam Maccarone]].On May 30, 2006 Claypool released a solo album, ''[[Of Whales and Woe]]'', with guest appearances by Skerik, Mike Dillon and Gabby La La.This album includes the song "Robot Chicken," which is the theme song of the popular [[Adult Swim]] show.His son Cage and his daughter Lena even make a special appearance on the song "Back Off Turkey."The release was followed by a tour of the U.S. with the following lineup: Les Claypool - bass, vocals 

 

Claypool's first book, ''[[South of the Pumphouse]]'', was released on July 1, 2006 by [[Akashic Books]].Copies of the book were sold during Claypool's 2006 tour of U.S.A. following the release of ''[[Of Whales and Woe]]''.The book is a dark, clever tale of brothers, murder, drugs, and fishing, and it has been likened to the work of [[Hunter S. Thompson]].Claypool gave his [http://www.thebookstandard.com/bookstandard/news/author/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002501410 first interview] about the book to The Book Standard, on May 11, 2006.''[[South of the Pumphouse]]'' is currently in its seventh printing.Besides touring in the Summer of 2007 nationally with the Fancy Band, Claypool performed that October with a version of the band, dubbed the Fancy Trio.The trio consisted of Les, Skerik on saxophone, and Mike Dillon on drums, vibraphone and percussion.They played at [http://www.the-echoproject.comThe Echo Project], an inaugural ecologically minded 3-day festival in [[Fairburn]], Georgia on The Boukeart family farm.The set was similar to that of The Fancy Band's tours, culling from Les' solo and Frog Brigade albums, as well containing a cover of "[[One Step Beyond (song)|One Step Beyond]]" by [[Madness (band)|Madness]] and teases of other songs, including several Primus tunes, throughout their improvisational jams.For many years Claypool has done a New Year's Eve show at [[The Fillmore]] in [[San Francisco, California]].More recently the New Year's Eve show has been an Annual New Year's Eve Hatter's Ball featuring a hat contest.December 31, 2007 was the 3rd such annual event.In 2008 a United States tour spanned from February 29 to April 5.It kicked off at the Neighborhood Theatre in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] and ended at [[The Warfield]] in [[San Francisco, California]].The 2008 tour was a quartet featuring Claypool, Dillon, Skerik and Baldi.During the year Claypool also performed several shows with Primus at festivals across America and Canada.''[[Pig Hunt]]'' is a film directed by James Isaac released in 2008.Claypool contributes previously unreleased material and plays the role of "The Preacher".<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1022883/Pig Hunt] at [[IMDB]]</ref><ref>[http://www.pighuntmovie.com/Pig Hunt] - official site</ref>

guitarist.<ref></ref>In 1974, Satriani studied music with [[jazz]] guitarist [[Billy Bauer]] and with reclusive [[jazz pianist]] [[Lennie Tristano]].The technically demanding Tristano greatly influenced Satriani's playing.Satriani began teaching guitar, with his most notable student at the time being fellow [[Long Island]] native [[Steve Vai]].While he was teaching Vai, he was attending [[Five Towns College]] for studies in music.In 1978, Satriani moved to [[Berkeley, California]] to pursue a music career.Soon after arriving in California, he resumed teaching.His students included

Alien]]'' produced popular radio hits and was the first all-instrumental release to chart so highly in many years.In 1988 Satriani helped produce the EP ''[[The Eyes of Horror]]'' for the [[death metal]] band [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]].In 1989, Satriani released the album ''[[Flying in a Blue Dream]]''.It was said to be inspired by the death of his father, who died in 1989 during the recording of the album."One Big Rush" was featured on the soundtrack to the [[Cameron Crowe]] movie ''[[Say Anything...]]''."The Forgotten Part II" was featured on a Labatt Blue commercial in Canada in 1993."Can't Slow Down" featured in a car-chase sequence in the Don Johnson starring show ''[[Nash Bridges]]''.In 1992, Satriani released ''[[The Extremist]]'', his most critically acclaimed and commercially successful album to date.Radio stations across the country were quick to pick up on "Summer Song," which got a major boost when [[Sony]] used it in a major commercial campaign for their [[Discman]] portable CD players.<ref></ref>"Cryin'," "[[Friends (Joe Satriani song)|Friends]]," and the title track were also regional hits on radio.In late 1993, Satriani joined [[Deep Purple]] as a temporary replacement for departed guitarist [[Ritchie Blackmore]] during the band's Japanese tour.The concerts were a success, and Satriani was asked to join the band permanently but he declined, having just signed a multi-album solo deal with [[Sony Records|Sony]], so [[Steve Morse]] took the guitarist slot in Deep Purple.<refname="Purple">[http://www.deep-purple.net/tree/mk6.htmSatriani's Offer of a Future with Deep Purple].Retrieved February 21, 2009.</ref>In 1996, Satriani founded the [[G3 (tour)|G3]], a concert tour intended to feature a power trio consisting of three [[instrumental rock]] guitarists.The original lineup featured Satriani, [[Steve Vai|Vai]], and [[Eric Johnson]].The G3 tour has continued periodically since its inaugural version, where Satriani is the only permanent member, featuring differing second and third members.Other guitarists who have performed in such a G3 configuration include among others: [[Yngwie Malmsteen]], [[John Petrucci]], [[Kenny Wayne Shepherd]], [[Robert Fripp]], [[Andy Timmons]], [[Ulrich Roth|Uli Jon Roth]], [[Michael Schenker]], [[Adrian Legg]] and [[Paul Gilbert]].In 1998 Satriani recorded and released ''[[Crystal Planet]]'', which went back to a sound more reminiscent of his late '80s work.Planet was followed up with ''[[Engines of Creation (album)|Engines of Creation]]'', one of his more experimental works featuring the 'Electronica' genre of music.During the subsequent tour, a pair of shows at the Fillmore in [[San Francisco]] were recorded in December 2000 and released as ''[[Live in San Francisco (Joe Satriani album)|Live in San Francisco]]'', a two-disc live album and [[DVD]].Over the next several years, Satriani regularly recorded and released evolving music, including ''[[Strange Beautiful Music]]'' in 2002 and ''[[Is There Love in Space?]]'' in 2004.In May 2005, Satriani toured India for the first time, playing concerts in Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai.In 2006 Satriani recorded and released ''[[Super Colossal]]'' and ''[[Satriani Live!]]'', another two-disc live album and DVD recorded May 3, 2006 at the Grove in Anaheim, CA.On August 7, 2007 Epic/Legacy Recordings re-released ''[[Surfing with the Alien]]'' to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its release.This was a two-disc set that includes a [[remastered]] album and a [[DVD]] of a previously never-before-seen live show filmed at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in 1988.<ref></ref>Satriani's next album, titled ''[[Professor Satchafunkilus and the Musterion of Rock]]'', was released on April 1, 2008.<ref></ref>Satriani released a live DVD recording of a concert in Paris titled ''[[Live In Paris: I Just Wanna Rock]]'' and a companion 2 CD set on February 2, 2010.<ref></ref>In March 2010 Satriani participated with other guitarists in the Experience Hendrix Tribute Tour, performing music written and inspired by [[Jimi Hendrix]].<ref></ref><ref></ref>In April, Satriani and the rest of Chickenfoot voiced themselves in an episode of the [[animated television series]] [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]].In May 2010, through his website, Satriani announced he was about to enter the studio to record a solo album, and dates were also released for an autumn tour.He also said that demos had been recorded for a second Chickenfoot album.In May 2010, Satriani joined Sound Strike, a movement led by [[Rage Against the Machine]] singer [[Zack de la Rocha]] protesting [[Arizona]] [[SB1070]].<refname "cbs-zack"></ref> As a result, Satriani refuses to perform live in Arizona.Satriani released his 14th studio album, titled ''[[Black Swans and Wormhole Wizards]]'', on October 5, 2010.<ref></ref>On December 4, 2008 Satriani filed a [[copyright infringement]] suit against [[Coldplay]] in the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]].Satriani's suit asserts that the Coldplay song "[[Viva la Vida]]" includes "substantial original portions" of the Satriani song "If I Could Fly" from his 2004 album, ''[[Is There Love in Space?]]''.The Coldplay song in question received two [[Grammy Award]]s for "Song of the Year."<ref></ref>Coldplay denied the

Satriani is also credited on many other albums, including guitar duties on [[Shock rock|shock-rocker]] [[Alice Cooper]]'s 1991 album ''[[Hey Stoopid]]'', [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]]'s 1992 album ''[[Break Like the Wind]]'', [[Blue Öyster Cult]]'s 1988 album ''[[Imaginos]]'', band members [[Stu Hamm]] and [[Gregg Bissonette]]'s solo albums.Interestingly, he was credited with singing background vocals on the 1986 debut album by [[Crowded House]].In 2003, he played lead guitar on [[The Yardbirds]]'s [[CD]] release ''[[Birdland (2003 Yardbirds recording)|Birdland]]''.In 2006 he made appearances on tracks for Deep Purple vocalist [[Ian Gillan]]'s solo CD/DVD dual disc ''[[Gillan's Inn]]''.On [[Dream Theater]]'s 2007 album, ''[[Systematic Chaos]]'', Satriani contributed spoken lyrics to the song "[[Repentance (song)|Repentance]]." Satriani contributed a guitar solo to [[Jordan Rudess]]' 2004 solo release ''[[Rhythm of Time]]''.He also composed much of the soundtrack for the racing [[video game]] ''[[NASCAR 06: Total Team Control]]'' and contributed to ''[[Sega Rally Championship]]''.He featured in the 2006 Christopher Guest film ''[[For Your Consideration (film)|For Your Consideration]]'' as the guitarist in the band that played for the late-night show.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0470765/fullcredits,Talk Show Guitarist.Retrieved 28 October 2009.]</ref>It was revealed on 29 May 2008 that Satriani was involved in a new [[hard rock]] band called ''[[Chickenfoot (band)|Chickenfoot]]'' with former [[Van Halen]] members [[Sammy Hagar]] and [[Michael Anthony (musician)|Michael Anthony]], and [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] drummer [[Chad Smith]].The band features Hagar on [[vocals]], Satriani on [[guitar]], Anthony on [[bass guitar|bass]] and Smith on [[Drum kit|drums]].<ref></ref>Their [[Chickenfoot (album)|debut album]] was released on 5 June 2009.<ref></ref>The first single and video released from this album is the track "Oh Yeah," which was also played on the 'Tonight' Show With Conan O'Brien on 5 June 2009.Satriani received a co-writing credit on all the songs featured on the band's debut album.<ref></ref>
When Broken Records magazine asked Satriani in volume 1 issue 3, about his new band, he enthusiastically mentioned that "it was great fun" and it gives him  a "kick in the music bone" to be playing with such great talent.He said it felt quite natural to step back and play more rhythm guitar than solo guitar.Chickenfoot's second CD was titled 'III', and was released on 27 Sept 2011.It's first single the track 'Bigfoot'.On its first week of release, it reached a chart position of #9.[[File:Joe Satriani 2005.jpg|Satrianilive on February 4, 2005.|thumb|right|Satriani in 2005]]
Satriani is recognized as a technically advanced rock guitarist, and is a guitar [[virtuoso]].<ref></ref><ref></ref>He has mastered many [[Guitar technique|performance techniques]] on the instrument, including [[legato]], two-handed [[tapping]] and [[arpeggio]] tapping, [[volume swell|volume swells]], [[harmonics]], and extreme [[whammy bar]] effects.During fast passages, Satriani favors a legato technique (achieved primarily through hammer-ons and pull-offs) that yields smooth and flowing runs.He is also adept at other speed-related techniques such as rapid [[alternate picking]] and [[sweep picking]], but does not use them often.Satriani has received 14 [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations<ref></ref> and has sold more than 10 million [[album]]s worldwide.<ref>[http://www.modernguitars.com/archives/001902.html Joe Satriani Interview<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Many of his fans and friends call him "Satch," short for "Satriani."An influential guitarist himself,<ref name="Guitar Hero">''Harmony Central'' April 21, 2008 [http://news.harmony-central.com/Newp/2008/WorkshopLive.com-Joe-Satriani-Lessons.html Real "Guitar Hero" Joe Satriani turns Teacher at WorkshopLive.com]</ref>Satriani has many influences, including Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck and Ritchie Blackmore.<ref></ref>Satriani has endorsed [[Ibanez]]'s [[Ibanez JS Series|JS Series]] guitars, and [[Peavey Electronics|Peavey]]'s [[Peavey Electronics#JSX series guitar amplifiers|JSX]] [[instrument amplifier|amplifier]].Both lines were designed specifically as signature products for Satriani.The Ibanez JS100 was based on, and replaced, the Ibanez 540 Radius model that Satriani first endorsed.However, Satriani uses a variety of gear.Many of his guitars are made by [[Ibanez]], including the JS1000, and JS1200.These guitars typically feature the [[DiMarzio]] PAF Pro (which he used up until 1993 in both the neck and bridge positions), the [[DiMarzio]] Fred (which he used in the bridge position from 1993 to 2005), and the Mo' Joe and the Paf Joe (which he uses in the bridge and neck positions, respectively, from 2005 to present day).The JS line of guitars is his signature line with the JS1000, JS1200, JS2400, JSBDG, and JS20th using Ibanez's original Edge double locking tremolo bridge.The JS100 and JS120s both use Ibanez's Edge 3 tremolo bridge.The JS1600 is a fixed bridge guitar with no tremolo system.The guitar he was most associated with during the nineties was a chrome-finished guitar nicknamed "Chrome Boy." (This instrument can be seen on the ''[[Live in San Francisco (Joe Satriani album)|Live in San Francisco]]'' DVD.)However, the guitar used for most of the concert was in fact a lookalike nicknamed "Pearly," which featured [[Seymour Duncan]] Pearly Gates pickups.Satriani uses a number of other JS models such as the JS double neck model, JS700 (primary axe on the self-titled CD and seen on the 1995 tour "Joe Satriani," which features a fixed bridge, [[P-90]] pickups, and a matching mahogany body and neck), JS6/JS6000 (natural body) , JS1 (the original JS model), JS2000 (fixed bridge model), a variety of JS100s, JS1000s and JS1200s with custom paint work, and a large amount of prototype JSs.All double locking bridges have been the original Edge tremolo, not the newer models, which point to a more custom guitar than the "off the shelf" models.Joe played a red 7-string JS model, seen in the "G3 Live in Tokyo" DVD from 2005.He also has a prototype 24-fret version of the JS&mdash 
[[Image:Joe Satriani and band.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Satriani and the band]]

Satriani's guitars are usually equipped with his signature DiMarzio humbucker pickups, Mo' Joe and PAF Joe, although his 24-fret JS model features a Pro Track single coil-sized, humbucker pickup in the neck position.Some of his guitars are still equipped with the pickup models he favored in the past, the DiMarzio FRED and PAF Pro pickups.Satriani has used a wide variety of [[guitar amps]], using [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] for his main amplifier (notably the limited edition blue coloured 6100 LM model) up until 2001, and his Peavey signature series amps, the Peavey JSX, thereafter.The JSX began life as a prototype Peavey XXX and developed into the Joe Satriani signature Peavey model.However he still used distortion pedals with the clean channel rather than the built in od channels.Satriani has used other amplifiers over the years in the studio, however.Those include the Peavey 5150 (used to record the song '[[Crystal Planet]]'), [[Cornford]], and the [[Mesa/Boogie]] Mark IIC+ (used to record the song '[[Flying in a Blue Dream]]'), amongst others.He has recently switched to the Marshall JVM series, having used a modified JVM 410H in his Black Swans and Wormhole Wizards tour in 2010 and with Chickenfoot in 2010 and 2011.These modified JVM Marshall amps are prototypes for a long-talked-about signature amp which is loosely scheduled for the end of 2011.The reverb has been replaced by noise gates which cancel any lag when switching channels.The clean channel has been replaced by the clean channel of a 6100 LM model which he likes as an option to use distortion pedals with.The orange od channel and the modern red od channel have been better matched with each other as he still claims to prefer the organic od channels of the JVM amp rather than pedals.The red od channel has been modified to be based more on beefy rock than a nu-metal sound.The fx-loop has also been simplified to be serial only.His [[effects pedals]] include the [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]] [[Wah-wah pedal|wah]], [[Dunlop Cry Baby]] wah, RMC Wizard Wah, [[DigiTech Whammy]], BK Butler Tube Driver, BOSS DS-1, BOSS CH-1, BOSS CE-2, BOSS DD-2 and a standard BOSS DD-3 (used together to emulate reverb effects), BOSS BF-3, BOSS OC-2, Barber Burn Drive Unit, Fulltone Deja Vibe, Fulltone Ultimate Octave, and Electro-Harmonix POG (Polyphonic Octave Generator), the latter being featured prominently on the title cut to his 2006 ''[[Super Colossal]]''.Satriani has partnered with Planet Waves to create a signature line of guitar picks and guitar straps featuring his sketch art.Although Satriani endorses the JSX, he has used many amps in the studio when recording, including the Peavey Classic.He used Marshall heads and cabinets, including live, prior to his Peavey endorsement.Most recently Satriani used the JSX head through a Palmer Speaker Simulator.He has also released a Class-A 5-watt tube amp called the "Mini Colossal."He is currently working with [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]] on his own line of signature effects pedals designed to deliver Satriani's trademark tone plus a wide range of new sounds for guitarists of all playing styles and ability levels.The first being a signature distortion pedal titled the "Satchurator," and recently, the "Time Machine," which will be a delay pedal, with more to follow in 2008, including a wah pedal called the "Big Bad Wah."<ref></ref>On March 3, 2010 a new pedal was announced on Satriani's website regarding the new Vox overdrive pedal called "Ice 9."<ref></ref>

  

In an interview conducted by Mike Blackburn in March of 1998…

MIKE:  "Can you describe how your current 'look' and stage persona evolved?"

JOE:  "Well its really quite simple.For as long as people have known about me I've been on a steady course of hair loss, and I got really tired of working around it.One day I was out jogging in San Francisco and my hair was quite long at the time (February 1996) and it was really bothering me and I jogged past a pharmacy store that had a hair clipper advertised in the window and I just went in and purchased it, ran back home and just shaved it all off.Then I went of course, oh my God I've just shaved my head.But I've had it for two years and I really enjoy it.It's more fun for me and I'm not a weave, fake hair kind of guy, so it's more honest and in line with my kind of music and my image of straight ahead."[[Image:20080612-220324 Joe Satriani Rijnhal Arnhem.jpg|Satrianiduring a concert at the Rijnhal, [[Arnhem]] (June 12, 2008)|thumb|right|200px]]

Satriani's work frequently makes references to various [[science fiction]] stories and ideas."Surfing with the Alien," "Back to [[Shalla-Bal]]," and "The Power Cosmic 2000" refer to the comic book character [[Silver Surfer]], while "Ice 9" refers to the secret government ice weapon in [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Cat's Cradle]]''."Borg Sex" is a reference to ''[[Star Trek]]'', which features a [[wiktionary:Homogeneous|homogeneous]] [[cybernetic]] race known as the [[Borg (fictional aliens)|Borg]].His albums and songs often have other-worldly titles, such as ''[[Not of This Earth (Joe Satriani album)|Not of this Earth]]'', ''[[Crystal Planet]]'', ''[[Is There Love in Space?]]'', and ''[[Engines of Creation (Joe Satriani album)|Engines of Creation]]''.On the album ''[[Super Colossal]]'' the song titled "Crowd Chant" was originally called "Party on the Enterprise.""Party on the Enterprise" featured [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] sounds from the [[Starship Enterprise]] from the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' TV show.But as Satriani explained in a [[podcast]], legal issues regarding the samples could not be resolved and he was unable to get permission to use them.<ref>[http://www.sonymusic.com/artists/JoeSatriani/podcast/super_colossal/13_crowd_chant_podcast.mp3]</ref> Satriani then removed the sounds from the song and called it "Crowd Chant."This song is now used as goal celebration music for a number of National Hockey League teams including the [[Minnesota Wild]].<ref></ref>This song is also used in EA Sports Hockey video game "NHL10"."Redshift Riders," another song on the ''[[Super Colossal]]'' album, is "based on the idea that in the future, when people can travel throughout space, they will theoretically take advantage of the cosmological [[redshift]] effect so they can be swung around large planetary objects and get across [the] universe a lot faster than normal," Satriani said in a [[podcast]] about the song.<ref>[http://www.sonymusic.com/artists/JoeSatriani/podcast/super_colossal/04_redshift_riders_podcast.mp3]</ref>

On the album ''Professor Satchafunkilus and the Musterion of Rock'' the song "I Just Wanna Rock," is about a giant robot on the run who happens to stumble upon a rock concert.<ref></ref>In 2006, Satriani signed on as an official supporter of [[Little Kids Rock]], a non-profit organization that provides free musical instruments and instruction to children in underserved public schools throughout the U.S.A. Satriani has personally delivered instruments to children in the program through a charity [[raffle]] for the organization and, like [[Steve Vai]], sits on its board of directors as an honorary member.Satriani has the second most [[Grammy Award]] nominations (after [[Brian McKnight]]), of any artist (15) without winning.[[Grammy Award records#Most nominations without winning|See further artists]]<ref></ref><ref></ref>

  SENTENCES: '''Lewis Brian Hopkins Jones''' (28 February 1942 &ndash 

His main instruments were the guitar and the harmonica, but he played a wide variety of other instruments.His innovative use of [[Traditional music|traditional or folk instruments]], such as the [[sitar]] and [[marimba]], was integral to the changing sound of the band.He was originally the leader of the group, but [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Keith Richards]] soon overshadowed him, especially after they became a successful songwriting team.Jones developed a serious drug abuse problem over the years and his role in the band steadily diminished.He left the Rolling Stones in June 1969 to be replaced by guitarist [[Mick Taylor]].Jones died less than a month later in his own swimming pool.Jones was born in the Park Nursing Home in [[Cheltenham]], [[Gloucestershire]], on 28 February 1942.An attack of [[croup]] at the age of four left him with [[asthma]], which lasted for the rest of his life.<refname "wymanp10p16">p.10.</ref>Both Jones's parents were interested in music: his mother Louisa was a piano teacher, and in addition to his job as an [[aeronautical engineer]], Lewis Jones played piano and [[organ (music)|organ]] and led the choir at the local church.<refname="wymanp10p16">p. 10 & 16.</ref>In 1957 Jones first heard [[Cannonball Adderley]]'s music, which inspired his interest in jazz.Jones persuaded his parents to buy him a [[saxophone]], and two years later his parents gave him his first acoustic guitar as a 17th birthday present.<refname="wymanp23">Wyman 2002.p. 23.</ref>

Jones attended local schools, including [[Dean Close School]], from September 1949 to July 1953 and [[Pate's Grammar School|Cheltenham Grammar School for Boys]], which he entered in September 1953 after passing the [[Eleven-plus]] exam.He enjoyed badminton and diving at school and became first [[clarinet]] in the school orchestra.In 1957 he reportedly obtained seven [[O-levels|O-level]] passes, then he continued into the [[sixth form]] and obtained a further two O-levels.He also took three [[A-levels]] in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and passed in Physics and Chemistry, but failed in Biology.<refname "wymanp23">Wyman 2002.p. 19.</ref>His hostility to authority figures resulted in his suspension from school on two occasions.<refname "wymanp19"/>

In the spring of 1959, Jones's 14-year-old girlfriend, a Cheltenham schoolgirl named Valerie Corbett, became pregnant.Although Jones is said to have encouraged her to have an abortion, she placed the baby boy up for adoption by an infertile couple.<refname="wymanp23"/>

Jones quit school in disgrace and left home, travelling through [[Northern Europe]] and [[Scandinavia]] for a summer.During this period, he lived a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle, [[busking]] with his guitar on the streets for money, and living off the charity of others.Eventually, Jones ran short of money and returned to England.<ref name="wymanp28">Wyman 2002.p. 28.</ref>

Jones grew up listening to classical music, but he preferred [[blues]], particularly [[Elmore James]] and [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]].He began playing at local blues and jazz clubs in addition to busking and working odd jobs.He was also known to steal small amounts of money from work to pay for cigarettes, which tended to get him fired.<refname="wymanp35-36">Wyman 2002.p. 35-36.</ref>In November 1959, Jones went to the Wooden Bridge Hotel in [[Guildford]] to see a group.He met a young married woman named Angeline, and the two had a one-night stand that resulted in her pregnancy.Angeline and her husband decided to bring up the baby together, a girl, born on 4 August the following year.Jones never knew about her birth.<refname="wymanp28">Wyman 2002.p. 28.</ref>In 1961, Jones applied for a scholarship to [[Cheltenham Art College]].He was initially accepted into the programme, however the offer was withdrawn two days later.Someone had written to the college saying Jones was an irresponsible drifter, and the college reconsidered the offer.<ref name="wymanp29">Wyman 2002.p. 29.</ref>On 23 October 1961, Jones's girlfriend Pat Andrews gave birth to his third child, Julian Mark Andrews.<ref name "wymanp144">Wyman 2002.p. 144.</ref>Brian's fifth child was born in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] on 24 March 1965, to teenager Dawn Molloy.He was originally named Paul Andrew Molloy.Dawn was forced to give the baby up for adoption and Paul's adoptive parents re-named him John.Finally, on 23 February 1969, Brian's sixth and youngest child was born to a married but separated American model named Elizabeth.Brian met Elizabeth on 12 May in Wembley and saw her a few times between 12 and 20 May.She and her husband were reunited in November 1968 and flew back to the United States.The baby, Brian's second daughter, was born in Chicago, IL, and named after Brian's surviving sister, Barbara.Barbara was brought up by Elizabeth and her husband.Jones left Cheltenham and moved to London where he became friends with fellow musicians [[Alexis Korner]], future [[Manfred Mann]] singer [[Paul Jones (singer)|Paul Jones]], future [[Cream (band)|Cream]] bassist [[Jack Bruce]] and others who made up the small London [[rhythm and blues]] and [[jazz]] scene there.He became a blues musician, for a brief time calling himself "Elmo Lewis", and playing [[slide guitar]].Jones also started a group with Paul Jones called the ''Roosters'' and in January 1963, after both Brian and Paul left the group, [[Eric Clapton]] took over Brian's position as guitarist.<ref></ref>Jones placed an advertisement in ''Jazz News'' (a Soho club information sheet) of 2 May 1962 inviting musicians to audition for a new R&B group at the Bricklayer's Arms pub 

As Keith Richards tells it, Jones came up with the name the "Rollin' Stones" (later with the 'g') while on the phone with a venue owner."The voice on the other end of the line obviously said, 'What are you called?' Panic.''The Best of Muddy Waters'' album was lying on the floor—and track one was 'Rollin' Stone Blues'".<refname="jaggerp0">Jagger, Mick 

The Rollin' Stones played their first gig on 12 July 1962 in the [[Marquee Club]] in London with Jagger, Richards, Jones, Stewart, [[bassist|bass player]] [[Dick Taylor]] (later of [[the Pretty Things]]) and drummer [[Tony Chapman]].<refname="karnbach-p57-58"></ref><ref>Some sources erroneously list [[Mick Avory]] as the drummer at that gig, but Avory himself denies it.</ref>From September 1962 to September 1963 Jones, Jagger and Richards shared a flat (referred to by Richards as "a beautiful dump")<ref name="jaggerp37">Jagger, Richards, Watts, Wood 2003.p. 37</ref> at 102 Edith Grove, [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], with James Phelge, a future photographer whose last name was used in some of the group's early "Nanker/Phelge" writing credits.Jones and Richards spent day after day playing guitar while listening to blues records (notably [[Jimmy Reed]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Willie Dixon]] and [[Howlin' Wolf]]).During this time, Jones also taught Jagger how to play [[harmonica]].The four Rollin' Stones went searching for a bassist and drummer, finally settling on [[Bill Wyman]] on bass because he had a spare [[VOX AC30]] [[guitar amplifier]] <ref name="Keith Richards 'Life">Richards p. 114</ref> and always had cigarettes, as well as a bass guitar that he had built himself.<ref>BillWyman, [http://www.billwyman.com/site/news/678/]</ref>After playing with [[Mick Avory]], [[Tony Chapman]] and [[Carlo Little]], in January 1963 they finally persuaded jazz-influenced [[Charlie Watts]] to join them.At the time, Watts was considered by fellow musicians to be one of the better drummers in London 

Watts described Jones's role in these early days: "Brian was very instrumental in pushing the band at the beginning.Keith and I would look at him and say he was barmy.It was a crusade to him to get us on the stage in a club and be paid half-a-crown and to be billed as an R&B band".<refname="jaggerp0">Jagger, Richards, Watts, Wood, 2003.</ref>The group played at local blues and jazz clubs, garnering fans in spite of resistance from traditional jazz musicians who felt threatened by their popularity.While Jagger was lead singer, Jones, in the group's embryonic period, was the leader—promoting the band, landing gigs, and negotiating with venue owners.Jones played guitar and [[harmonica]], and during performances, especially at the [[Crawdaddy Club]] in Richmond, he proved to be a more lively and engaging performer than even Jagger.While acting as the band's business manager, Jones received £5 more than the other members, which did not sit well with the rest of the band and created resentment.<refname="jaggerp0"/>  Keith Richards has said that both he and Mick were surprised to learn that Brian considered himself the leader and was receiving the extra £5, especially as other people, like [[Giorgio Gomelsky]], appeared to be doing the booking.<ref>Richards,Keith and James Fox. Life.2010: Little, Brown & Company, pp.125-126.</ref>[[File:Rolling Stones band 1965.jpg|thumb|275px|right|BillWyman (left), Brian Jones (centre) and Mick Jagger (right) onstage with the Rolling Stones, 1965]]
Jones's main guitar in the early years was a [[Harmony Company|Harmony]] Stratotone, which he replaced with a [[Gretsch]] Double Anniversary in two-tone green.In 1964 and 1965 he often used a teardrop-shaped prototype [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox Mark VI]].From late 1965 until his death, Jones used [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] models (various Firebirds, ES-330, and a [[Gibson Les Paul|Les Paul model]]), as well as two [[Rickenbacker]] [[twelve string guitar|12-string]] models.He can also be seen playing a Fender Telecaster in the 1968 "[[Jumpin' Jack Flash]]" promo video.Examples of Jones's contributions are his slide guitar on "[[I Wanna Be Your Man]]" (1963), "[[I'm a King Bee]]" (1964, on the ''Rolling Stones''), "[[Little Red Rooster]]" (1964), "I Can't Be Satisfied" (1965, on ''Rolling Stones No. 2''), "[[I'm Movin' On (Hank Snow song)|I'm Movin' On]]" (1965, on the EP ''Got Live If You Want It!''), "Doncha Bother Me" (1966, on ''Aftermath'') and "[[No Expectations]]" (1968, on ''Beggars Banquet'').Jones can also be heard playing Bo Diddley-style rhythm guitar on "[[I Need You Baby (Mona)]]", the guitar riff in [[The Last Time (song)|"The Last Time"]] 

Jones also played harmonica on many of the Rolling Stones' early songs.Examples of Jones's playing are on "[[Stoned (The Rolling Stones song)|Stoned]]" (1963), "[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]" (1964), "[[I Just Want to Make Love to You]]", "Now I've Got A Witness" (1964)" (from ''The Rolling Stones''), "Good Times, Bad Times" (1964), "[[2120 South Michigan Avenue]]" (1964) (from E.P. ''Five By Five''), "The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man", "One More Try" (1965) (from ''Out Of Our Heads''), "High and Dry" and "[[Goin' Home (The Rolling Stones song)|Goin' Home]]" (1966) (from ''Aftermath''), "Who's Driving Your Plane?" (1966), "Cool Calm and Collected", "Who's Been Sleeping Here" (1967) (from ''Between The Buttons''), and "[[Dear Doctor (song)|Dear Doctor]]" and "Prodigal Son" (1968) (from ''Beggars Banquet'').In the early years, Jones also sometimes served as a backing vocalist.Notable examples are "[[Come On (Chuck Berry song)|Come On]]", "I Wanna Be Your Man", "I Just Wanna Make Love to You", "[[Walking the Dog]]", "[[Money (That's What I Want)]]", "I'm Alright", "[[You Better Move On (song)|You Better Move On]]" and "[[It's All Over Now]]".He contributed backing vocals as late as 1968 on "[[Sympathy For The Devil]]".He is also responsible for the whistling on "Walking the Dog."<ref></ref>Richards maintains that what he calls "[[Multiple guitar players|guitar weaving]]"<ref>[http://odeo.com/audio/5490053/viewRolling Stones' Guitar Weaving (Podcast)-Q107 Toronto]</ref> emerged from this period, from listening to [[Jimmy Reed]] albums: "We listened to the teamwork, trying to work out what was going on in those records 

From 1966 onwards Jones's contributions in the recording studio were more as a multi-instrumentalist than as a guitarist.His aptitude for playing a wide variety of instruments is particularly evident on the albums ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' (1966), ''[[Between the Buttons]]'' (1967) and ''[[Their Satanic Majesties Request]]'' (1967).[[Andrew Loog Oldham]]'s arrival marked the beginning of Jones's slow estrangement, his prominent role gradually diminishing as the Stones' centre shifted from Jones to Jagger and Richards.Oldham recognised the financial advantages of bandmembers writing their own songs, as exemplified by [[Lennon/McCartney]], and that playing covers would not sustain a band in the limelight for long.Further, Oldham wanted to make Jagger's charisma and flamboyance a focus of live performances.Jones saw his influence over the Stones' direction slide as their repertoire comprised fewer of the blues covers that he preferred 

According to Andrew Loog Oldham in his book ''Stoned'', Jones was an outsider from the beginning.<ref>AndrewLoog Oldham, ''Stoned'' (St.Martin's Press, 2005), p. 210 - 300.</ref>When the first tours were arranged in 1963, Jones travelled separately from the band, stayed at different hotels, and demanded extra pay.According to Oldham, Jones was very emotional, and felt alienated because he was not a prolific song writer and his management role had been taken away.Jones "resisted the symbiosis demanded by the group lifestyle, and so life was becoming more desperate for him day by day.None of us were looking forward to Brian totally cracking up".<ref>Oldham 2005.p. 210.</ref>The toll from days on the road, the money and fame and the feeling of being alienated from the group resulted in Jones's overindulgence in alcohol and other drugs.He frequently used [[LSD]], pills, and [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], and he drank heavily.These excesses had a debilitative effect on Jones's physical health, and according to Oldham, Jones became unfriendly and anti-social at times.His health problems caused him to be hospitalized on a number of occasions.Jones was arrested for drug possession on 10 May 1967, shortly after the "Redlands" incident at Richards's Sussex home.Authorities found marijuana, [[cocaine]], and [[methamphetamine]] in Jones's flat.He confessed to marijuana use but claimed he did not use hard drugs.Reacting in a manner similar to the arrests of his band mates, protesters appeared outside court demanding that Jones be freed, and he was not kept in jail.He was fined, given [[probation]], and ordered to see a counselor.In June 1967, Jones attended the [[Monterey Pop Festival]], with singer [[Nico]], with whom he had a brief relationship.There he met [[Frank Zappa]] and [[Dennis Hopper]], and went on stage to introduce the [[Jimi Hendrix Experience]], not well known yet in the USA.One review referred to Jones as "the unofficial 'king' of the festival".Hostility grew between Jones, Jagger and Richards, alienating Jones further from the group.Although many noted that Jones could be friendly and outgoing, Wyman and Richards have both commented that Jones could also be cruel and difficult.<ref>Richardsand Fox, Life, pp.271-272</ref>  By most accounts, Jones's attitude changed frequently, one minute caring and generous, the next making an effort to anger everyone.As Wyman observed in ''Stone Alone'': "There were two Brians... one was introverted, shy, sensitive, deep-thinking... the other was a preening peacock, gregarious, artistic, desperately needing assurance from his peers... he pushed every friendship to the limit and way beyond".As tensions and Jones's substance use increased, his musical contributions became sporadic.He became bored with the guitar and sought exotic instruments to play, and he was increasingly absent from recording sessions.In the promotional film for "We Love You", made in July 1967, he appears groggy.However, Jones maintained close relationships with many performing artists outside of the Stones camp, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[George Harrison]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[John Lennon]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Noel Redding]], [[Steve Winwood]], [[Eric Burdon]] and [[Steve Marriott]].In March 1967, [[Anita Pallenberg]], Jones's girlfriend of two years, left him for Richards when Jones was hospitalized during a trip the three made to [[Morocco]],<ref>Life, pp.198-199</ref> further damaging the already strained relations between Jones and Richards.Jones's last substantial sessions with the Stones occurred in spring and summer of 1968, when the Stones produced "[[Jumpin' Jack Flash]]" and the ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' album.He can be seen in the [[Jean-Luc Godard]] film ''[[Sympathy for the Devil (film)|One Plus One]]'' playing acoustic guitar, chatting and sharing cigarettes with Richards, although Jones is neglected in the music-making.The film chronicles the making of "[[Sympathy for the Devil]]".Jones's acoustic guitar can be heard occasionally in the film through the microphones of the film crew but was not included in the released version.It was clear Jones was not long for the group.Where once he played multiple instruments on many tracks, now he played only minor roles on a few pieces.Jones's last formal appearance was in the December 1968 ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'', a part concert, part circus-act film organised by the band.It went unreleased for 25 years because Jagger was unhappy with the band's performance compared to others in the film, such as [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[the Who]], and [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]].<refname "rnrcircus"></ref>

 
Jones was arrested a second time on 21 May 1968, for possession of cannabis, which Jones said had been left by previous tenants of the flat.He was facing a long jail sentence if found guilty, owing to his probation.Wyman commented, "The fact that the police had secured a warrant with no evidence showed the arrest was part of a carefully orchestrated plan.Brian and the Stones were being targeted in an effort to deter the public from taking drugs".The jury found him guilty, but the judge had sympathy for Jones 

Jones's legal troubles, estrangement from his bandmates, [[substance abuse]] and [[mood swings]] became too much of an obstacle to active participation in the band.The Rolling Stones wanted to tour the United States in 1969 for the first time in three years, but Jones was not in fit condition to tour and his second arrest exacerbated problems with acquiring a US work visa.In addition, Jones's attendance of rehearsals and recording sessions had become erratic 

This behaviour was problematic during the ''Beggar's Banquet'' sessions, and had worsened by the time the band commenced recording ''[[Let It Bleed]]''.In March 1969, Jones borrowed the group's Jaguar and went shopping in Pimlico Road.After the parked car was towed by police, Jones hired a chauffeur car to get home.<refname "wymanp323">Wyman 2002.p. 323</ref> By May, he had made two contributions to the work in progress: [[autoharp]] on "[[You Got the Silver]]" and percussion on "[[Midnight Rambler]]".The Stones decided that following the release of the ''Let it Bleed'' album (scheduled for a July 1969 release in the US), they would start a [[North America]]n tour in November 1969.However, the Stones management was informed that because of his drug convictions, Jones would not receive a work permit.At the suggestion of pianist and road manager [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]], the Stones decided to add a new guitarist, and on 8 June 1969, Jones was visited by Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Charlie Watts, and was told that the group he had formed would continue without him.<refname="wymanp324-326">Wyman 2002.p. 324-326</ref>

To the public, it appeared as if Jones had left voluntarily 

During the period of his decreasing involvement in the band, Jones was living at Cotchford Farm in [[East Sussex]], the residence formerly owned by ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh]]'' author [[A. A. Milne]], which Jones had purchased in November 1968.There is uncertainty as to the mental and physical state Jones was in.The last known photographs of Jones, taken by schoolgirl Helen Spittal on 23 June 1969, shortly after his departure from the Stones, are not flattering 

 
At around midnight on the night of 2–3 July 1969, Jones was discovered motionless at the bottom of his swimming pool at Cotchford Farm.His [[Sweden|Swedish]] girlfriend, Anna Wohlin, was convinced he was alive when they took him out, insisting he still had a pulse.However, by the time the doctors arrived, it was too late, and he was pronounced dead.The coroner's report stated "death by misadventure", and noted his liver and heart were heavily enlarged by drug and alcohol abuse.<refname="wymanp329"/> As Jones was 27 at the time of his death, he is one of the well known members of the [[27 Club]].<ref>[http://www.upvenue.com/music-news/blog-headline/1026/the-27-club-musicians-who-died-at-27-years-old.htmlThe 27 Club]</ref>

Many items, such as instruments and expensive furniture, reportedly were stolen from the home after Jones's death.Rumours also exist that recordings by Jones for his future projects were stolen but nothing has surfaced to date.A watch given by Alexis Korner to Jones, with a personal inscription, surfaced in an auction at [[Christie's]] in [[New York City|New York]].Upon Jones's death, [[Pete Townshend]] of [[the Who]] wrote a poem titled "A Normal Day for Brian, A Man Who Died Every Day" (printed in ''The Times''), [[Jimi Hendrix]] dedicated a song to him on US television, and [[Jim Morrison]] of [[The Doors]] published a poem entitled "Ode to L.A.While Thinking of Brian Jones, Deceased".Hendrix and Morrison both died at the same age as Jones.<ref></ref>The Rolling Stones performed at a free concert in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] on 5 July 1969, two days after Jones's death.The concert had been scheduled weeks earlier as an opportunity to present the new guitarist, and the band decided to dedicate the concert to Jones.Before the Rolling Stones' set, Jagger read excerpts from "[[Adonais]]", a poem by [[Percy Shelley]] about the death of his friend [[John Keats]], and stagehands released hundreds of white butterflies as part of the tribute.The band opened with a [[Johnny Winter]] song that was one of Jones's favourites, "I'm Yours and I'm Hers".Jones was reportedly buried  deep in Cheltenham Cemetery (to prevent exhumation by trophy hunters) in a lavish casket sent by [[Bob Dylan]].Watts and Wyman were the only Rolling Stones who attended the funeral.Mick Jagger and [[Marianne Faithfull]] were travelling to [[Australia]] to begin the filming of ''[[Ned Kelly (1970 film)|Ned Kelly]]'' 

When asked if he felt guilty about Jones's death, Mick Jagger told Rolling Stone in 1995: "No, I don't really.I do feel that I behaved in a very childish way, but we were very young, and in some ways we picked on him.But, unfortunately, he made himself a target for it 

 
Conspiracy theories surrounding Jones' death developed soon afterwards, with associates of the ''Stones'' claiming to have information that he was murdered.<refname  "wymanp328">Wyman 2002.p. 328-9.</ref>The Thorogood theory was dramatised in the 2005 movie ''[[Stoned (film)|Stoned]]''.<ref>EricSegalstad, Josh Hunter, ''The 27s: The Greatest Myth of Rock & Roll'', Samadhi Creations, LLC, 2009.</ref>In August 2009 Sussex Police decided to review Jones's death for the first time since 1969, after new evidence was handed to them by Scott Jones, an investigative journalist in the UK.Scott Jones had traced many of the people who were at Brian Jones's house the night he died, plus unseen police files held at the National Archives.In the ''Mail on Sunday'' in November 2008 Scott Jones said Frank Thorogood killed Brian Jones in a fight and the senior police officers covered up the true cause of death.Following the review the Sussex police stated that they would not be reopening the case.They asserted that "this has been thoroughly reviewed by Sussex Police's Crime Policy and Review Branch but there is no new evidence to suggest that the coroner’s original verdict of “death by misadventure” was incorrect.As such, the case will not be reopened."<ref>"Death of Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones case will not reopen despite new evidence which suggests he was murdered", ''Mail On Sunday'', 31st October 2010.</ref>Unsure and insecure as a composer, Jones was not a prolific songwriter.The 30-second "Rice Krispies" jingle for [[Kellogg Company|Kellogg's]], co-written with the [[J.W. Thompson]] advertising agency in 1963 and performed by the Rolling Stones incognito was credited to Jones 

According to Andrew Oldham, the main reason for Jones not writing songs was that Jones, being a blues purist, did not love simple pop music enough.Oldham tried to establish a songwriting partnership between Jones and [[Gene Pitney]] after "becoming bored senseless by Jones's bleating about the potential of half-finished melodies that by no means deserved completion" but after two days of sessions "the results remain best to be unheard, even by Stones' completists".<ref>Oldham2005.p. 288.</ref>When asked in 1965 if he had written songs, Jones replied: "Always tried.I've written quite a few, but mostly in blues style".<ref>''NMENew Musical Express'', December 1965.</ref>Many years later after his death, Keith Richards stated: "No, no, absolutely not.That was the one thing he would never do.Brian wouldn't show them to anybody within the Stones.Brian as far as I know never wrote a single finished song in his life 

He is credited (along with Keith Richards) for the instrumental piece 

However, in 1966 Jones composed, produced and played on the soundtrack to ''[[Mord und Totschlag]]'' (English title: ''A Degree Of Murder''), an avant-garde German film with Anita Pallenberg.Guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] is one of the musicians Jones hired to play on the soundtrack.In 1990, [[Carla Olson]] was given permission from Jones's estate to put one of his poems to music and thus created the Jones/Olson song "Thank You For Being There".It appeared on the album ''True Voices'', performed by Krysia Kristianne and Robin Williamson.[[Image:Brian Jones guitar, HRC Sacramento.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Jones's [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox Mark VI]], retired for display]]
In summer 1968, Jones recorded the [[Morocco]]-based ensemble, the [[Master Musicians of Joujouka]] 
In mid-May 1967, Jones played [[oboe]] on the Beatles' "[[Baby You're A Rich Man]]" 

 
Brian Jones was regarded as a fashion icon due to his rebellious and flamboyant style.His style of dress and manner did much to influence the fashion scene of swinging 1960s London.Anita Pallenberg has stated in an interview that he wanted to look like [[Françoise Hardy]], he loved 'dressing up and posing about' and that he would ask her to do his hair and make-up.<refname = "AnitaP"></ref>

He was 5'6" (1.68m) tall with blue-grey eyes and blond hair.<ref></ref>His death at 27 was the first of the '60s rock movement 

The Stones' ''[[Shine a Light (song)|Shine a Light]]'' was written by Jagger after his death and depicts Jones's behaviour and remoteness from the band, and asks God to shine a light on his soul.<ref></ref>Several other songs have been written about Jones: [[The Doors]]' song "Tightrope Ride" was originally written for Jones by Morrison, but after Morrison's death [[Ray Manzarek]] rewrote some of the lyrics so that they apply to both musicians.The [[Psychic TV]] song "Godstar" is about Jones's death, as are [[Robyn Hitchcock]]'s "Trash", [[The Drovers]]' "She's as Pretty as Brian Jones Was" and [[Ted Nugent]]'s "Death by Misadventure".[[Toy Love]]'s song "Swimming Pool" lists several dead rock icons including Jones (the others are Morrison, Hendrix, and [[Marc Bolan]]) 

The 2005 film ''[[Stoned (movie)|Stoned]]'' is a fictional account of Jones and his role in the Rolling Stones.The part of Brian was played by English actor [[Leo Gregory]].A fictionalised version of Jones and the tribute concert to him appears in [[Alan Moore]] and [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]]'s ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume III: Century]]'' in its second issue, "Paint it Black".:Jones plays on "Midnight Rambler" and "You Got The Silver"

  SENTENCES: '''James Roger McGuinn''' (known professionally as '''Roger McGuinn''', previously as '''Jim McGuinn''', and born '''James Joseph McGuinn III''' on July 13, 1942)<ref></ref> is an [[United States|American]] [[singer-songwriter]] and [[guitar]]ist.He is best known for being the lead singer and lead guitarist on many of [[The Byrds]]' records.He is a member of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] for his work with The Byrds.Roger McGuinn was born and raised in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]].His parents, James and Dorothy, were involved in [[journalism]] and [[public relations]], and during his childhood, they had written a bestseller titled ''Parents Can't Win''.He attended [[The Latin School of Chicago]].He became interested in music after hearing [[Elvis Presley]]'s "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]", and asked his parents to buy him a [[guitar]].(During the early 1980s, he paid tribute to the song that encouraged him to play guitar by including "Heartbreak Hotel" in his autobiographical show).Around the same time, he was also influenced by country artists and/or groups such as [[Johnny Cash]], [[Carl Perkins]], [[Gene Vincent]], and [[The Everly Brothers]].In 1957, he enrolled as a student at Chicago's [[Old Town School of Folk Music]],<ref name "ibiblio1"/>

In 1962, after he ended his association with the Chad Mitchell Trio, McGuinn was hired by Darin to be a backup guitarist and harmony singer.(At that approximate time, Darin wanted to add some folk roots to his repertoire because it was a burgeoning musical field.)Unfortunately, about a year and a half after McGuinn began to play guitar and sing with Darin, Darin became ill and retired from singing.Subsequently, Darin opened T.M. Music in [[New York City]]'s [[Brill Building]], hiring McGuinn as a song writer for $35 a week.During 1963, just one year before he co-founded The Byrds, he was a studio musician in New York City, recording with Judy Collins and [[Simon & Garfunkel]].At the same time, he was hearing of [[The Beatles]] (whose first American tour would commence in February 1964), and wondering how [[Beatlemania]] might affect folk music.By the time [[Doug Weston]] gave McGuinn a job in Los Angeles, at the [[Troubadour]], McGuinn had included Beatles' songs in his act.He gave rock style treatments to traditional folk tunes and thereby caught the attention of another folkie Beatle fan, [[Gene Clark]], who joined forces with McGuinn in July 1964.Together they formed the beginning of what was to become The Byrds.<ref name="ibiblio1"/>

 
During his time with The Byrds, McGuinn developed two innovative and very influential styles of electric guitar playing: "jingle-jangle" – generating ringing [[arpeggio]]s based on [[banjo]] [[Fingerstyle guitar|finger picking]] styles he learned while at the Old Town School 
[[File:Roger MdGuinn in 1972-by Dan Volonnino.jpg|thumb|220px|McGuinnwith The Byrds at a concert held at [[Washington University in St. Louis]]]]
While "tracking" The Byrds' first single, "[[Mr.Tambourine Man]]", at [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] studios, McGuinn discovered an important component of his style."The 'Ric' <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Rickenbacker#Rickenbacker guitars and 1960s rock and roll|Rickenbacker guitar]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> by itself is kind of thuddy," he notes."It doesn't ring.But if you add a [[Audio level compression|compressor]], you get that long [[Sustain (music)|sustain]].To be honest, I found this by accident.The [[Audio engineering|engineer]], Ray Gerhardt, would run compressors on everything to protect his precious equipment from loud rock and roll.He compressed the heck out of my [[Twelve-string guitar|12-string]], and it sounded so great we decided to use two [[Vacuum tube|tube]] compressors [likely Teletronix LA-2As] in series, and then go directly into the [[Mixing console|board]].That's how I got my 'jingle-jangle' tone.It's really squashed down, but it jumps out from the radio.With compression, I found I could hold a note for three or four seconds, and sound more like a [[wind instrument]].Later, this led me to emulate John Coltrane's [[saxophone]] on "[[Eight Miles High]]".Without compression, I couldn't have sustained the riff's first note."<ref></ref>"I practiced eight hours a day on that 'Ric,'" he continues, "I really worked it.In those days, [[12-string guitar|acoustic 12s]] had wide necks and thick strings that were spaced pretty far apart, so they were hard to play.But the Rick's slim neck and low action let me explore [[jazz]] and [[blues music|blues]] scales up and down the [[fingerboard|fretboard]], and incorporate more [[hammer-on]]s and [[pull-off]]s into my solos.I also translated some of my banjo picking techniques to the 12-string.By combining a [[Plectrum|flat pick]] with [[Finger pick|metal finger picks]] on my middle and ring fingers, I discovered I could instantly switch from fast single-note runs to banjo rolls and get the best of both worlds."<ref></ref>Another sound that McGuinn developed is made by playing a [[Seven string guitar#Other seven-string guitars|seven string guitar]], featuring a doubled G-string (with the second string tuned an octave higher).The [[C.F. Martin & Company|C.F. Martin]] guitar company has even released a special edition called the ''HD7 Roger McGuinn Signature Edition'', that claims to capture McGuinn's "jingle-jangle" tone which he created with 12 string guitars, while maintaining the ease of playing a 6-string guitar.The Byrds recorded several albums after ''Mr.Tambourine Man'' in 1965.The single, "[[Turn!Turn! Turn!]]", written by [[Pete Seeger]] with the lyrics drawn from [[Ecclesiastes]] in the Old Testament, was The Byrds' second Number One success in late 1965.In 1969, McGuinn's solo version of the "Ballad Of Easy Rider" appeared in the film ''[[Easy Rider]]'', while a full band version was the title track for the album released later that year.1970's "Untitled" album featured a 16-minute version of The Byrds' 1966 hit "Eight Miles High", with all four members taking extended solos representative of their "jam-band" style of playing during that period.<ref></ref>After several personnel changes, the group disbanded in 1973, with [[Chris Hillman]] playing bass with the band for their final show in February of that year.Notable band members included [[David Crosby]], [[Gene Clark]], [[Michael Clarke (musician)|Michael Clarke]], [[Clarence White]], [[Skip Battin]] and [[Gram Parsons]], all of whom went on to form successful groups.In 1968, McGuinn helped create the groundbreaking Byrds album ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]'', to which many attribute the rise in popularity of [[country rock]].McGuinn originally conceived the album as a blend of rock, jazz and other styles 

 
After the break-up of The Byrds, McGuinn released several solo albums throughout the 1970s.He toured with [[Bob Dylan]] in 1975 and 1976 as part of Dylan's "[[Rolling Thunder Revue]]".In late 1975, he played guitar on the track titled "Ride The Water" on [[Bo Diddley]]'s ''The 20th Anniversary of Rock 'n' Roll'' all-star album.In 1978, McGuinn joined fellow ex-Byrds [[Gene Clark]] and [[Chris Hillman]] to form "McGuinn, Clark and Hillman", and the three together recorded an album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979.The media loved the band and they performed on many TV rock shows, including repeated performances on The Midnight Special, where they played both new material and Byrds hits."Don't You Write Her Off" reached #33 in April 1979.While some believe that the slick production and disco rhythms didn't flatter the group, and the album had mixed  critically and commercial response, it sold enough to generate a follow up.McGuinn, Clark and Hillman's second release was to have been a full group effort entitled "City", but a combination of Clark's unreliability and his dissatisfaction with their musical direction (mostly regarding Ron and Howard Albert's production) resulted in the billing change on their next LP "City" to "Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman, featuring Gene Clark".By 1981 Clark had left and the group continued briefly as "McGuinn/Hillman".In 1987 Roger McGuinn was the [[opening act]] for Dylan and [[Tom Petty]].In 1991 he released his comeback solo album, ''[[Back from Rio]]'' to successful acclaim.It included the hit single "King of the Hill," written by and featuring Petty.On July 11, 2000, McGuinn testified before in a [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] hearing on downloading music from the [[Internet]] that artists do not always receive the royalties that (non-Internet based) record companies state in contracts, and that to date, The Byrds had not received any royalties for their greatest successes, "Mr.Tambourine Man" and "Turn, Turn, Turn" – they only received advances, which were split five ways and were just "a few thousand dollars" per band member.He also stated that he was receiving 50 percent royalties from [[MP3.com]].<ref></ref>McGuinn currently tours as a solo artist.Roger McGuinn has used the [[World Wide Web]] to continue the folk music tradition since November 1995 by recording a different folk song each month on his [http://www.ibiblio.org/jimmy/folkden-wpFolk Den] site.The songs are made available from his Web site, and a selection (with guest vocalists) was released on [[compact disc|CD]] as ''Treasures from the Folk Den'', which was nominated  for a Grammy Award in 2002 for  Best Traditional Folk Album.In November 2005, McGuinn released a four-CD box set containing one hundred of his favorite songs from the Folk Den.<ref></ref>When he originally started with The Byrds, he used the name Jim, which he thought to be too plain.During 1965 McGuinn briefly explored the [[Subud]] spiritual association and began to practice the [[latihan]], an exercise in quieting the mind.McGuinn changed his name in 1967 after Subud's founder [[Muhammad Subuh Sumohadiwidjojo|Bapak]] told him it would better "vibrate with the universe."Bapak sent Jim the letter "R" and asked him to send back ten names starting with that letter.Owing to a fascination with airplanes, gadgets and [[science fiction]], he sent names like "Rocket", "Retro", "Ramjet", and  "Roger", the latter a term used in [[Voice procedure|signalling protocol]] over two-way radios, military and [[civil aviation]].Roger was the only "real" name in the bunch and Bapak chose it.While using the name Roger professionally from that time on, McGuinn only officially changed his middle name from Joseph to Roger.McGuinn left the Subud spiritual association in 1977, the same year that he met his wife Camilla (they married the next year).Both have become committed [[Christianity|Christians]] since that time.<ref></ref>McGuinn also appears on the various artists anthology ''Adios Amigo: A Tribute to Arthur Alexander'' (1994).McGuinn performs a cover version of "Anna".He contributed two tracks, "Banjo Cantata" and "Ramblin' On", to a compilation of banjo pieces released by Davon as ''Banjo Greats'' (Volumes 1 & 2), re-issued on CD by Tradition in 1996 as ''Banjo Jamboree''.He has also performed the songs "It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" and "The Ballad of Easy Rider" which were included on the [[Easy Rider (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] of the film ''[[Easy Rider]]''.Another soundtrack that features McGuinn is the 1977 film ''Ransom''.McGuinn performed "Shoot 'Em" which appears on the anthology album ''Byrd Parts 2'', released on Australia's Raven Records label in 2003.McGuinn also appears with Bruce Springsteen on the live download "Magic Tour Highlights (Live)" singing "Turn!Turn! Turn!"  Roger McGuinn also did guitar the work in The Beach Boys version of California Dreaming video.[[Category:1942 births]]

  SENTENCES: '''Anthony James "Lonnie" Donegan''' [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (29 April 1931 &ndash 

 
Born as '''Anthony James Donegan''' in [[Bridgeton, Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], the son of a professional [[violin]]ist who had played with the [[Scottish National Orchestra]], he moved with his family in 1933 to [[East Ham]], [[Essex]] (now in [[Greater London]]).<refname="AMG"></ref>

Donegan was evacuated to [[Cheshire]] to escape [[the Blitz]] in [[World War II]], and he attended [[St Ambrose College]], initially at the school's original site in Dunham Road, [[Altrincham]].In the early 1940s he mostly listened to [[Swing music|swing jazz]] and vocal acts, and became interested in the [[guitar]].<refname "MTV"></ref>

The first [[musical ensemble|band]] he played in was the [[trad jazz]] band led by [[Chris Barber]], who approached him on a train asking him if he wanted to audition for his band.Barber had heard that Donegan was a good [[banjo]] player 

In 1952 he formed his first group, the Tony Donegan Jazzband, which found some work around London.On one occasion they opened for the blues musician [[Lonnie Johnson]] at the [[Royal Festival Hall]].<refname="AMG"/> Donegan was a [[fan (person)|fan]] of Johnson, and took his first name as a tribute to him.The story goes that the host at the concert got the musicians' names confused, calling them "Tony Johnson" and "Lonnie Donegan", and Donegan was happy to keep the name.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/ilove/years/1960/music2.shtml''I love 1960s music: Lonnie Donegan''] (BBC) accessed 5 January 2008.</ref>In 1953 [[cornet]]ist [[Ken Colyer]], enjoying hero status for having spent time in a [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]  jail (due to a visa problem), returned to England and, when invited to play with Chris Barber's band, became a moving figure within it.With the new name, Ken Colyer's Jazzmen, the group, with Donegan, made its initial public appearance on 11 April 1953 in [[Copenhagen]].The following day, [[Chris Albertson]] recorded the group (as well as a Monty Sunshine Trio, with Donegan and Barber) for [[Storyville Records]].These were Donegan's first commercially released recordings.While playing in [[Ken Colyer]]'s Jazzmen with [[Chris Barber]], Donegan [[singer|sang]] and played both [[guitar]] and [[banjo]] as part of their [[Dixieland]] jazz set.He also began playing with two other band members during the intervals, to provide what was called on their posters a "skiffle" break, a name suggested by Ken Colyer's brother, Bill, after recalling the [[Dan Burley]] Skiffle Group of the 1930s.<refname MTV/>

With a [[washboard]], a [[tea-chest bass]] and a cheap Spanish guitar, Donegan entertained audiences with folk and blues songs by [[musician|artists]] such as [[Leadbelly]] and [[Woody Guthrie]].<refname "AMG"/> 

He travelled to the United States, where he appeared on television on both the ''[[Perry Como]] Show'' and the ''[[Paul Winchell]] Show''.<refname "British Hit Singles & Albums"/>

Donegan went on to make a series of popular records with successes including "[[Cumberland Gap (folk song)|Cumberland Gap]]" and particularly "[[Does Your Chewing Gum Lose It's Flavor (On The Bedpost Over Night)|Does Your Chewing Gum Lose Its Flavour (On The Bedpost Over Night)]]", his only hit song in the U.S., released on [[Dot Records|Dot]].<ref name "AMG"/>

He continued to appear regularly in the UK charts until 1962, before succumbing to the arrival of [[The Beatles]] and [[beat music]].<refname="AMG"/>

 
Donegan recorded sporadically during the 1960s, including some sessions at [[Hickory Records]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]] with [[Charlie McCoy]], [[Floyd Cramer]] and [[The Jordanaires]].After 1964, he was primarily occupied as a [[record producer]] for most of the decade at Pye Records.Among those he worked with during this period was [[Justin Hayward]].<refname="AMG"/> 

Donegan was unfashionable and generally ignored through the late 1960s and 1970s (although he wrote "I'll Never Fall in Love Again" for [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] in 1967), and he began to play on the American [[cabaret]] circuit.A notable departure from his normal style was an [[a cappella]] recording of "[[The Party's Over (1956 song)|The Party's Over]]".There was a reunion concert with the original Chris Barber band in [[Croydon]] in June 1975 - notable for a bomb scare, meaning that the recording had to be finished in the studio, though patrons were treated to an impromptu concert in the car park.The resultant release was entitled ''The Great Re-Union Album''.<refname="AMG"/>

He suffered his first [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in 1976 while in the [[United States]] and underwent [[quadruple bypass]] surgery.He returned to the public's attention in 1978, when he made a record of his early songs with such figures as [[Ringo Starr]], [[Elton John]] and [[Brian May]] called ''Putting on the Style''.<refname "AMG"/>

In 1994, the Chris Barber band celebrated 40 years, with a tour with both bands.[[Pat Halcox]] was still on trumpet (a position he retained until July 2008).The reunion concert and the tour were recorded on CD and DVD.Donegan experienced another late renaissance when in 2000 he appeared on [[Van Morrison]]'s album ''[[The Skiffle Sessions - Live In Belfast 1998]]'', a critically acclaimed album featuring Donegan sharing vocals with Van Morrison and also featuring  Chris Barber, with a guest appearance by [[Dr.John]].Donegan also played at the [[Glastonbury Festival]], and was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] in 2000.Donegan's final CD was ''This Y'ere the Story''

 
Donegan married three times.He had two daughters by his first wife, Maureen Tyler (divorced 1962), a son and a daughter by his second wife, Jill Westlake (divorced 1971), and three sons by his third wife, Sharon, whom he married in 1977.He was the second cousin three times removed of the [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[Gaelic Football]]er, [[Chris Pendergast]].Lonnie Donegan died in 2002, aged 71, after suffering a heart attack in [[Market Deeping]] mid-way through a UK tour and shortly before he was due to perform at a memorial concert for [[George Harrison]] with [[The Rolling Stones]].He had suffered from cardiac problems since the 1970s and had several heart attacks in his last years.[[Mark Knopfler]] released a tribute song to Donegan entitled "Donegan's Gone" on his 2004 album, ''[[Shangri-La (Mark Knopfler album)|Shangri-La]]'', and said that he was one of his greatest musical influences.<refname=obit/> Donegan's music formed the basis for a [[musical theatre|musical]] starring his two sons.''Lonnie D - The Musical'' took its name from the [[Chas & Dave]] tribute song which started the show.Subsequently, [http://www.peterdonegan.comPeter Donegan] formed a new band that performed his father's material and has since linked up with his father's band from the last 30 years with newcomer Eddie Masters on bass.They released an album together in 2009 entitled "Here We Go Again".Donegan's eldest son, Anthony, also formed his own band, under the name Lonnie Donegan Jnr.On his album ''[[A Beach Full of Shells]]'', [[Al Stewart]] paid tribute to Donegan in the song "Katherine of Oregon".Additionally, in the song "Class of '58", he describes a seminal British entertainer who is either Donegan or a composite including him.''[[NME]]'' - June 1956<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years"></ref>

In 1958, Campbell moved to Los Angeles to become a [[session musician]].He was part of the 1959 line-up of the group [[the Champs]], famous for their instrumental "Tequila".Campbell was in great demand as a session musician in the 1960s.He was part of the studio musicians clique known as "[[The Wrecking Crew (music)|the Wrecking Crew]]", many of whom went from session to session together as the same group.In addition to Campbell, [[Hal Blaine]] on drums, [[Tommy Tedesco]] on guitar, [[Leon Russell]] on piano, [[Carol Kaye]] on bass guitar, [[Al Casey (rock & roll guitarist)|Al Casey]] on guitar were part of this group of session musicians that defined many pop and rock recordings of the era.They were also heard on [[Phil Spector]]'s "[[Wall of Sound]]" recordings in the early 1960s.He was a touring member of [[the Beach Boys]], filling in for [[Brian Wilson]] in 1964 and 1965.He played guitar on the group's ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' album, among other recordings.On tour, he played bass guitar and sang falsetto harmonies.He can be seen briefly in the 1965 film ''[[Baby the Rain Must Fall]]'' playing guitar in support of [[Steve McQueen (actor)|Steve McQueen]].Campbell was also the uncredited lead vocalist on ''"My World Fell Down"'' by the psychedelic rock act [[Sagittarius (band)|Sagittarius]], which became a minor hit in 1967.<ref>[All Music Guide]</ref>

 
As a solo artist, he had moderate success regionally with his first single, "[[Turn Around, Look at Me]]"."Too Late to Worry, Too Blue to Cry" and "Kentucky Means Paradise" (cut with a [[bluegrass (music)|bluegrass]] group called the Green River Boys) were similarly popular within only a small section of the country audience.In 1962, Campbell signed with [[Capitol Records]] and released two instrumental albums and a number of vocal albums during his first five years with the label.However, despite releasing singles written by Brian Wilson ("Guess I'm Dumb" in 1965) and [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]] the same year ("The Universal Soldier"), Campbell did not achieve major success as a solo artist.It was rumored that Capitol was considering dropping him from the label in 1966 when he was teamed with producer Al DeLory, and together they collaborated on 1967's [[Bob Dylan|Dylanesque]] "[[Gentle on My Mind (song)|Gentle on My Mind]]", written by [[John Hartford]]."Gentle on My Mind" was an overnight success.It was followed by the even bigger triumph of "[[By the Time I Get to Phoenix]]" later in 1967, and "[[I Wanna Live (Glen Campbell song)|I Wanna Live]]" and "[[Wichita Lineman]]" in 1968.The 1969 song “True Grit” by composer Elmer Bernstein and lyricist Don Black, and sung by Campbell, who co-starred in the movie, received nominations for both the Academy Award for Best Song and the Golden Globe.Campbell won two [[Grammy Awards]] for his performances on "Gentle on My Mind" and "By the Time I Get to Phoenix".His biggest hits in the late 1960s were the songs written by [[Jimmy Webb]]: "By the Time I Get to Phoenix," "[[Wichita Lineman]]", "Where's the Playground, Susie?" and "[[Galveston (song)|Galveston]]".An album of mainly Webb-penned compositions, ''[[Reunion: The Songs of Jimmy Webb]]'', was released in 1974, but it produced no hit single records."Wichita Lineman" was selected as one of the greatest songs of the 20th century by ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine in 1997 and by ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' in 2001.After he hosted a 1968 summer replacement for television's ''The [[Smothers Brothers]] Comedy Hour'' variety show, Campbell hosted his own weekly variety show, ''[[The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour]]'', from January 1969 through June 1972.At the height of his popularity, a 1970 biography by Freda Kramer, ''The Glen Campbell Story'', was published.With Campbell's session-work connections, he hosted major names in music on his show including: [[the Beatles]] (on film), [[David Gates]] and [[Bread (band)|Bread]], [[the Monkees]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Roger Miller]] and helped launch the careers of [[Anne Murray]], [[Mel Tillis]] and [[Jerry Reed]] who were regulars on his ''Goodtime Hour'' program.In 1973, [[banjo]] player [[Carl Jackson]] joined Campbell's band for 12 years and went on to win two Grammy awards.<ref>[http://www.carljackson.net/biography.phpBiography of Carl Jackson - Grammy Award Winning - Singer, Songwriter, Musician, Producer, & Publisher<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

(U.S. #11)."Rhinestone Cowboy" was Campbell's largest-selling single, initially with over 2 million copies sold in a matter of months.Campbell had heard the songwriter Larry Weiss' version while on tour of Australia in 1974 and felt it was the perfect song for him to record.It was included in the ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' movie parody song "Mr.Jaws", which also reached the top 10 in 1975."Rhinestone Cowboy" continues to be used in movie soundtracks and TV shows, including "[[Desperate Housewives]]", ''[[Daddy Day Care]]'', and ''[[High School High]]''.It was the inspiration for the 1984 [[Dolly Parton]]/[[Sylvester Stallone]] movie ''[[Rhinestone (film)|Rhinestone]]''.Campbell made a techno/pop version of the song in 2002 with UK artists [[Ricardo Autobahn|Rikki & Daz]] and went to the top 10 in the UK with the dance version and related music video."Southern Nights," by [[Allen Toussaint]], his other #1 pop-rock-country [[crossover (music)|crossover]] hit, was generated with the help of [[Jimmy Webb]], who turned Campbell onto the song, and [[Jerry Reed]], who inspired the famous guitar lick introduction to the song, which was the most-played [[jukebox]] number of 1977.From [[1971 PGA Tour|1971]] to [[1983 PGA Tour|1983]], Campbell was the celebrity host of the [[Northern Trust Open|Los Angeles Open]], an annual professional [[golf]] tournament on the [[PGA Tour]].Campbell made a cameo appearance in the 1980 [[Clint Eastwood]] movie ''[[Any Which Way You Can]]'', for which he recorded the title song.In 1999 Campbell was featured on [[VH-1]]'s ''[[Behind the Music]]'', [[A&E Network]]'s ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'' in 2001, and on a number of [[CMT]] programs.Campbell ranked 29th on ''CMT's 40 Greatest Men of Country Music'' in 2003.[[File:Glen Campbell 2004.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|Campbell in 2004.]]He is also credited with giving [[Alan Jackson]] his first big break.Campbell met Jackson's wife (a flight attendant with [[Piedmont Airlines (1948-1989)|Piedmont Airlines]]) at [[Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta Airport]] and gave her his publishing manager's business card.Jackson went to work for Campbell's music publishing business in the early 1990s and later had many of his hit songs published in part by Campbell's company, Seventh Son Music.Campbell also served as an inspiration to [[Keith Urban]].Urban cites Campbell as a strong influence on his performing career.In 2005, Campbell was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]].It was announced in April 2008 that Campbell was returning to his signature label, Capitol, to release his new album, ''[[Meet Glen Campbell]]''.<ref>[http://www.themonthly.com.au/tm/node/1223The Return of the Wichita Lineman] review by [[Robert Forster]] in ''[[The Monthly]]''</ref> The album was released on August 19.With this album he branched off in a different musical direction, covering tracks from artists such as [[Travis (band)|Travis]], [[U2]], [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], [[Jackson Browne]] and [[Foo Fighters]].It was Campbell's first release on Capitol in over 15 years.Musicians from [[Cheap Trick]] and [[Jellyfish (band)|Jellyfish]] contributed to the album as well.The first single, a cover of [[Green Day]]'s "[[Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)]]", was released to radio in July 2008.In March 2010, a farewell album titled ''[[Ghost on the Canvas]]'' was announced which served as a companion to ''Meet Glen Campbell''.<ref></ref>

  SENTENCES: '''Ray Stevens''' (born '''Harold Ray Ragsdale''', January 24, 1939<ref>http://www.raystevens.com/bio/index.php</ref>) is an [[United States|American]] [[country music]], [[pop music|pop]] [[singer-songwriter]] who has become known for his [[novelty songs]].He was born in [[Clarkdale, Georgia]], a small town west of [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]].Stevens' recording career began in the mid-1950s with two singles released on [[Prep Records]].He then signed a contract with [[Capitol Records]] with the help of [[Atlanta, Georgia]] music maven [[Bill Lowery]].In 1958, Stevens joined Lowery's [[National Recording Corporation]] (NRC), playing numerous instruments, arranging music, and performing background vocals for its band.After NRC filed for bankruptcy, he signed with [[Mercury Records]] with whom Stevens recorded a series of hit records in the 1960s that included songs such as "[[Ahab the Arab]]", "[[Harry the Hairy Ape]]", "Funny Man," the original recording of "[[Santa Claus Is Watching You]]", and "[[Jeremiah Peabody's Polyunsaturated Quick-Dissolving, Fast-Acting Pleasant-Tasting Green and Purple Pills]]".The song that introduced Stevens to most of his fan base is a shortened version of "[[Ahab the Arab]]", which reached #5 on the [[Hot 100]] in the summer of 1962.In 1966, Stevens signed with [[Monument Records]] and started to release serious material such as "Mr.Businessman" in 1968, a Top 30 pop hit 

As an [[A&R]] man, [[music producer]], [[songwriter]], and [[music arranger]] he assisted countless artists in the recording studio during his years at Mercury Records and Monument Records, 1961 through early 1970.Some of the acts he was associated with during that time period were [[Brenda Lee]], [[Brook Benton]], [[Patti Page]], [[Joe Dowell]], [[Dusty Springfield]], and [[Dolly Parton]].Stevens was a writer or co-writer of several songs those particular acts recorded.'' [[My True Confession]] '', a Top-10 on the [[R&B]] chart in 1963 for Brook Benton, was written by Stevens and [[Margie Singleton]].Stevens was the arranger for an obscure [[Doyle Holly]] recording titled "[[My Heart Cries For You]]" which had been recorded previously by Stevens during the late 1950s.Starting in the 1970s, Stevens became a producer and well-known studio musician on the [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] scene.He recorded songs for [[Barnaby Records]] and [[Warner Brothers]] during 1970–1979.Stevens' biggest hit in the [[United States]] was his gospel-inflected single "[[Everything Is Beautiful]]" (1970).The single won a [[Grammy Award]], was the theme song for his summer 1970 TV show, hit #1 on both the pop and Adult-Contemporary charts, and marked his first time in the Top 40 on the country charts, peaking at #39.It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<refname="The Book of Golden Discs"></ref> His other 1970 singles were "America, Communicate With Me" and "Sunset Strip", both of which reached the Top-20 on the Adult-Contemporary lists.His novelty song "Bridget the Midget (The Queen of The Blues)" made #2 on the [[United Kingdom]] chart in 1971 and in the US it reached #50.Stevens had a gospel/country hit single in early 1972 with [[Albert E. Brumley]]'s "[[Turn Your Radio On]]", reaching the country Top 20.Two more of Stevens' songs in 1971 were also minor pop hits, "A Mama and a Papa" and "All My Trials," but both crossed over to the Top 10 Adult-Contemporary lists.Stevens frequently toured Canada and went overseas to the UK.A rock-infected gospel arrangement accompanied his version of "Love Lifted Me" and it became a hit single in [[Bangkok]] in the fall of 1972, finding its way into the Top-5 for the week ending September 30.In 1973, Stevens had a top 40 country hit with the title track of his album, "Nashville", and increased his exposure on television by performing on a variety of prime-time programs of the era.In 1974, Stevens recorded perhaps his most famous hit, "[[The Streak]]", which poked fun at the early-1970s fad of running nude in public, known as "[[streaking]]".It made No. 1 in both the UK and the US and No. 3 on the country chart.In 1975, he released the Grammy-winning "[[Misty (song)|Misty]]", which became his biggest country hit (reaching #3 on the country charts and #14 on the pop charts) 

Stevens joined Warner Brothers in 1976, where his debut was a strong showing with three hit singles in a row.The first was the up-tempo version of "[[You Are So Beautiful]]", which reached the country Top 20, then "[[Honky Tonk Waltz]]", which reached the Top 30.He then released a novelty single: under the pseudonym "Henhouse Five Plus Too," Stevens recorded a version of [[Glenn Miller]]'s "[[In The Mood]]" in the style of a clucking chicken 

 
After joining RCA in 1980, Stevens continued having hit singles, but with somewhat less success than in the previous decade.His debut single, the Top 10 "[[Shriner's Convention]]" and then the Top 20 love ballad "[[Night Games]]" performed relatively well on the charts.In 1981, only one single made the charts, the Top 40 hit "One More Last Chance."In 1982, after he had released a few more singles, notably the Top 40 "Written Down in My Heart", Stevens left RCA and returned to Mercury Records, the label that made him a star in the early 1960s.This resulted in only one album, the 1983 project ''Me'', and only one chart hit, "My Dad", in early 1984.Stevens then joined MCA in 1984 as a "country comedy" act and thereafter released only novelty song albums.The fan-voted Music City News awards named Stevens Comedian of the Year annually for nine consecutive years from 1986 to 1994.However, Stevens' singles were no longer making the Top 40 charts as they were considered comedy–novelty, and country radio resisted playing songs that were not serious.A few of Stevens' commercial singles charted on the Single Sales charts during this time, but only one single, "[[Mississippi Squirrel Revival]]", made it to the Top 40."Mississippi Squirrel Revival" reached the Top 20, making that his final single to hit the Top-40 portion of the country singles chart."Would Jesus Wear a Rolex" is the only single during his 1984–1989 stint on MCA that came close to reaching the Top 40, stalling at #41 in 1987.Second to that, the other single close to hitting the Top 40 on the country chart was the #45 hit "The Haircut Song" in 1985.His comedy albums were nonetheless enjoying widespread success.His first series of albums for MCA all made the country charts with several of them remaining on the charts for months at a time.His first two albums for MCA reached the Top-5 with ''I Have Returned'' hitting the top spot in early 1986.Afterward his albums routinely peaked in the middle of the charts.A 1987 ''Greatest Hits'' album became a [[platinum]] seller while several other releases achieved gold status.One of the trademarks of Stevens' string of comedy albums were the photo shoots.For example, on one album he's dressed up as [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], on another he's [[Humpty Dumpty]], and on another he's dressed as General [[Douglas MacArthur]].Stevens' lack of airplay wasn't affecting his ability to sell records.National shows like [[Hee-Haw]] and a variety of programs on [[The Nashville Network]] that frequently gave exposure to all forms of country music.Stevens left MCA in 1989 for Curb/Capitol Records.His first release arrived in 1990.The two labels split up soon after and Curb Records continued releasing material on Stevens.''His All-Time Greatest Comic Hits'', a compilation project released by Curb in 1990, became a gold album by mid-decade.''Lend Me Your Ears'' and ''#1 With a Bullet'' were released in 1990 and 1991 respectively.The latter featured the satirical hit "Working for the Japanese" in which Stevens sings about the [[Economy of the United States|American economy]] and how dollars are boosting overseas economies instead of its own.In the 1990s, Stevens took new directions.The most ambitious was the opening of his own theater in [[Branson, Missouri]] in 1991.The theater business had been steadily growing in the small Missouri town of Branson for a period of years and by the time Stevens began building his theater the area was reaching its peak.Stevens benefited from the theater boom largely because his [[stage show]] was different from others.His reputation as a comedian and as an all-around entertainer meant that for most tourists his show was one of the destination spots judging by the number of sold-out performances he gave at the theater.When crowds reacted favorably to his music videos being played on a large screen at his theater Stevens began selling videos for his fans to take home.In the spring and summer of 1992, his ''[[Comedy Video Classics]]'' became a million-selling home video through [[direct marketing]] and [[television advertisements]].Commercials for Stevens' home video aired countless times throughout 1992, mostly in the morning hours and often during late-night.Branson was also experiencing its highest commercial peak in the summer and fall of both 1992 and 1993.Ray Stevens was back in the national media once again with his enormously successful home video and music theater.In the midst of all the success, though, Stevens closed down his theater after the 1993 season citing exhaustion and monotony after doing two shows a day, six days a week, for five to six months at a time.Several of his performances at his theater were filmed and surfaced in home video form.''Ray Stevens Live!'' became another home video mail-order success in 1993 following the same path of ''Comedy Video Classics''.Meanwhile, ''Comedy Video Classics'' had become available for retail distribution and it became a big seller again.In 1993, it was named Home Video of the Year by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine in their annual end of the year publication which cites the most popular artists, songs, CDs, and video items of the year.''Classic Ray Stevens'' was issued in the early fall of 1993.This was the first audio release from Stevens since early 1991.The album's title was a reference to the classical-looking photo shoot which features a bust of Ray Stevens mocking [[Beethoven]].The home video of ''Ray Stevens Live!'' was released to retail stores in 1994 and it became a Top-5 success on Billboard's Home Video chart.The concert video often ranked above or below ''Comedy Video Classics'' on the charts.In the late summer of 1995, the movie ''Get Serious!'' was released on home video.The movie, which runs 1 hour and 50 minutes, offers several plots and a collection of newly-produced music videos which act as commentary to the action.One [[plot point]] of the movie centers on a fictional record company for which Stevens records being bought out by a Japanese conglomerate.This is a reference to the [[Consolidation (business)|consolidation]] practices taking place in the music industry.Another plot-point deals with Stevens' reputation as a comical singer and how the new executive of the fictional record company, based vocally on [[Paul Lynde]], wants Stevens to change his image from comedy to classical opera.Stevens refuses and this brings to the surface another plot-point of the movie: political correctness.Seeking revenge on Stevens, the executive hatches a plan to ruin Stevens’ career by labeling him politically incorrect.The last plot-point centers on character defamation as numerous characters from several Stevens songs turn out to really exist and they want to sue the singer for defamation.This plot is based on a song that Stevens recorded in 1986 entitled "Dudley Dorite of the Highway Patrol" where a local policeman stops Stevens for speeding and afterward informs the singer that he's in a whole lot of trouble for using easily identifiable people as characters in his songs.The song was re-recorded specifically for the movie as Dudley Dorite is one of the main characters in the movie.He's portrayed by Stevens' long-time songwriting partner, [[C.W. Kalb, Jr.]].The home video became another mail-order success throughout 1995 and was released to retail stores, via MCA, late in 1996.The video hit the Top-5 on Billboard's Home Video chart early in 1997 during a more than 20 week chart run.Stevens had by this point exited Curb Records.Stevens found a new home with his previous label, MCA.MCA was responsible for the retail distribution of ''Get Serious!'' and for marketing Ray as a comical singer for the first time in the mid-1980s.The reunion with MCA consisted of the retail release of ''Get Serious!'' in late 1996 and two new audio CD's in 1997: ''[[Hum It]]'' and ''Christmas Through a Different Window'', the latter release being a collection of Christmas novelty songs.After the MCA contract ended, Stevens became exclusive to his own label, Clyde Records, for a period of years.On-line rumors began circulating about his death.The confusion may have arisen in the summer of 1996 following the death of a wrestler named Ray "The Crippler" Stevens.The singer Ray Stevens once recorded a wrestling song entitled "The Blue Cyclone".Stevens the singer reported to the media that his office had received thousands of sympathy cards due to the confusion.In April 1999 Stevens was diagnosed with early stage [[prostate cancer]] and had to cancel his series of concerts at the [[Acuff Theatre]] that summer.Stevens received a clean bill of health upon successful surgery and returned to the stage in time to deliver his Christmas concert series.After the partnership with MCA ended, he remained active on his own label, Clyde Records, until he found another home with Curb Records, returning to the label in 2001.Early in 2002,  "[[Osama Yo' Mama]]" was released.It made the country Top 50, reached the Top-5 on the country single sales chart, achieved Gold selling status, and the album of the same name reached the country Top-30.After the release of this album Stevens returned to Branson, Missouri and re-opened his theater in 2004.He remained active there for three more seasons.He shut the theater down for good after the 2006 season, selling it off to cable network [[RFD-TV]], which continues to operate it to this day.An obscure release called "The New Battle of New Orleans" came along in 2005 as a response to the vandals and looters in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]].Many people confused the version of ''The New Battle of New Orleans'' by its principal writer, [[Chuck Redden]], with the version by Stevens.The recording by the writer features much more pointed accusations and assertions and it is this version which appears on various web-sites specializing in lyric re-printing.The confusion arises when these web-sites credit Stevens as the singer of that version.Ray and his songwriter friend Buddy Kalb removed a lot of the original lyrics in the song and supplied new lyrics in a more G-rated setting.In spite of the various lyrical re-writes by Stevens and Kalb, the overall point of the song that the locals expected and demanded too much from their government, is still clear.The song was issued as a single-only in 2005.Curb Records, in the meantime, continued to release DVD music video collections on Stevens during this time.The music videos featured limited animation.Stevens returned to releasing music once again in 2007, firstly in July 2007, with the single-only "Ruby Falls", a combination of jazz, blues, and country music, and secondly with the CD ''[[New Orleans Moon]]'', released on his own label.This CD contains various songs in tribute and honor to New Orleans and Louisiana.Stevens covers "[[Louisiana Man]]", "Louisiana", "[[The Battle of New Orleans]]", "[[Way Down Yonder in New Orleans]]", "New Orleans", and several more.The following year Stevens issued the album ''Hurricane'', also on his own label.It was released in February 2008 at Stevens' on-line music store at his website then was released nationally in November of that year to a wider audience.This CD featured a wide array of comical songs including a pair of redneck anthems, "Hey Bubba, Watch This!" and "Bubba the Wine Connoisseur".The CD also marked the debut of "[[Sucking Sound]]", a political/economic song about [[Ross Perot]] and how his warnings of the flaws in a global economy, which were mocked in 1992, became somewhat of a reality by 2008 resulting in massive lay-offs and job losses.Concurrently in 2008, a tribute to the songs of [[Frank Sinatra]] that Stevens recorded was also being offered at the web-site store during the latter half of 2008.The album is titled ''[[Ray Stevens Sings Sinatra...Say What??]]'' and it became nationally distributed in February 2009.Stevens did not promote or publicize the tribute album.Later in 2009 he released ''[[One for the Road (Ray Stevens album)|One for the Road]]'', a CD aimed primarily at truckers.It was sold exclusively at the [[Pilot Travel Centers|Pilot]] truck stops for several weeks prior to its release nationally.The CD contains a mixture of material ranging from truck driver oriented songs to somber ballads.There are also several re-recordings of his greatest hits added into the equation.There are fifteen tracks featured on the trucker CD in which the first three tracks, in addition to track seven, specifically deal with situations while on the road: "Concrete Sailor", "Convoy", "Right Reverend Road Hog McGraw", and "Hang Up and Drive"."Mary Lou Nights" and "[[Oh, Lonesome Me]]"."Retired" originated as a duet between Stevens and [[Brent Burns]] but for this CD it is delivered [[Solo (music)|solo]].In 2009 Stevens was inducted into the Christian Music Hall of Fame and he appeared on the PBS series ''[[Legends and Lyrics]]''.A television show that Stevens stars in, ''We Ain't Dead Yet'', became available to subscribers at his web page.The subscription is to an exclusive section of his web-page called "Ray Stevens Backstage" and each month a different episode becomes available.The series focuses on senior citizens and it usually features a special guest each episode stopping by the main set, a retirement home, to perform songs.In the early fall of 2009 Stevens released a holiday collection of songs titled ''[[Ray Stevens Christmas]]''.Late in November an [[Extended play|EP]] became available featuring a couple of his serious Christmas songs but the main attraction was his cover of Seymour Swine's (a fictional group that recorded a stuttering rendition of "[[Blue Christmas]]") "Blue Christmas", complete with stutter.Stevens had also recorded a non-comical version of this song for his ''Ray Stevens Christmas'' release.The stuttering version can only be found on the EP release.In December 2009, Stevens issued the single and on-line video "We the People", which quickly became a [[viral video]] and surpassed a million unique views in a month's time on [[You Tube]].The video is critical of [[health care reform]].Stevens followed this music video with "[[Caribou Barbie]]" in March 2010.This music video is supportive of [[Sarah Palin]].The video uses a Palin impersonator and through the help of sight-gags it takes aim at several high-profile personalities on [[cable television]].Stevens issued another music video on YouTube, "[[Throw the Bums Out!]]", as a direct response to the March 2010 passage of health care reform legislation in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].In April 2010 Stevens released a collection that includes a CD and a DVD, titled ''We the People''.The project features 22 political songs.The four music videos on the DVD are "We the People", "Caribou Barbie", "Throw the Bums Out!", and "Thank You".Stevens appeared in [[Washington, D.C.]], on April 15, 2010, as part of the tax day rally associated with the Tea Party.On April 24, 2010 the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum]] honored the career of Ray Stevens in the recurring series "Nashville Cats: A Celebration of Music City Musicians".The special focused mostly on Stevens' career as a Nashville-session musician during the 1960s and 1970s.On May 13, 2010, the music video of "Come to the USA", was released.This is a song dealing with the [[hot button]] issue of [[illegal immigration]].The song uses exaggeration and small doses of satire to comment on illegal immigration acceptance internationally compared with the United States’ more passive policy.The song was written and recorded before the [[Arizona]] illegal immigration bill, [[SB 1070]], was introduced to the nation.The music video became Stevens' second to surpass a million unique views on You Tube 

Starting in July 2010 and running through August most [[PBS]] stations aired a special titled ''[[Marvin Hamlisch]] Presents the 1970s: The Way We Were'' during [[pledge drive]] fundraisers.The special celebrates the music of the 1970s and Ray Stevens participated in the proceedings.Stevens' contributions include "[[Everything Is Beautiful]]", "[[The Streak]]", and "[[Misty (song)|Misty]]".On July 31 Stevens made a guest appearance on the [[Grand Ole Opry]].On August 4, 2010 a new music video from Stevens made its debut on You Tube.This time around the subject matter is the [[Federal Government of the United States]] and the on-going war of words with [[Arizona]] over immigration.The song, "God Save Arizona", criticizes the policies of the Federal Government and it questions the competence of [[Eric Holder]], the [[United States Attorney General]] with regards to the Federal lawsuit brought against Arizona.The beginning of the song starts out as a tribute to the [[USS Arizona (BB-39)|U.S.S. Arizona]] during [[World War II]] before switching to a look at a modern-day verbal war between Arizona's State Government and the Federal Government.Given the overall on-line popularity of his music videos on You Tube it enabled Stevens to reach a milestone in early September 2010.This milestone refers to the collective number of plays that all of his music videos had obtained up until that point in time.When the play totals for each officially-released music video were tallied the collective total reached ten million."[[Come to the USA]]" obtained over four million You Tube unique views while "We the People" had obtained over three million.Stevens returned to Branson, Missouri once again in mid September to kick off a nearly month-long engagement at [[The Welk Resort]] which ran through October 23.On the last date of his concert series at the Welk Theatre he participated in a Tea Party rally held in Branson earlier in the day.The rally was billed as 'the Pre-Election Pink Slip Rally and Concert' and it took place throughout most of the morning and into the afternoon.Stevens performed "We the People" and "[[Throw the Bums Out!]]" at the rally and that night wrapped up his concert series at the Welk Theatre.On November 3, the day after the 2010 mid-term elections, Stevens uploaded a new music video on You Tube entitled "[[Nightmare Before Christmas]]".The song has nothing to do with politics or elections but instead deals with [[political correctness]] gone [[Running amok|amuck]] as [[Santa Claus]] gets arrested and is charged with crimes against a politically correct society.In the video Stevens portrays himself, Santa, the prosecutor, and the Judge.Political correctness and the mockery of [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]-[[Progressivism|progressive]] [[special interest]] groups is at the crux of the song.On November 29 Stevens alerted his audience via the [[social network]] site [[Twitter]] that he would be recording ten new political comedy songs.Several days prior, on November 23, Stevens announced on his [[Facebook]] page that he's in the process of recording a huge project of one hundred songs to be released at some point entitled ''The Encyclopedia of Musical Comedy Recordings''.On December 2, "[[Bad Angel]]", a song that Stevens published and his daughter, [[Suzi Ragsdale]], co-wrote, was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in the [[Best Country Collaboration]] category.The song's trio of artists are [[Dierks Bentley]], [[Miranda Lambert]], and [[Jamey Johnson]].It is available on Bentley's CD ''Up on The Ridge''.On January 19, 2011 via Twitter, Stevens announced that he would take part in the annual [[Conservative Political Action Conference|CPAC]] gathering in Washington, D.C.The event takes place during February 10–12.On January 24 Stevens turned 72 years old and showing no signs of slowing down he embarked on what he referred to as a radio call-in tour.The first program that Stevens called was the [[Charlie Brennan]] radio show on [[KMOX]] in [[St.Louis]] on January 28 to promote a brand new recording about [[airport security]] and the [[Transportation Security Administration]] (TSA).Next, on February 2, Ray called in to [[KWEL]] in Texas to promote his TSA song and the latest happenings in his career.Stevens called-in to the [[Jim Bohannon]] radio program on February 4 resulting in an interview that lasted about one hour.On February 7 he called-in to the [[Martha Zoller]] program and a radio program that aired on Minnesota's [[KLTF]].On February 8 a CD single along with an [[Mp3]] single of ''The Skies Just Ain't Friendly Anymore'' became commercially available.On February 9 Stevens was spotlighted on the [[XM]] and [[Sirius]] satellite radio program ''Cruisin' with Cousin' Brucie'' which spotlights 1960s pop songs.Stevens performed three songs while at [[Conservative Political Action Conference|CPAC]] on February 10, 2011.The airport security/TSA song entitled ''The Skies Just Ain't Friendly Anymore'' kicked off the performance while he followed it with "We the People" and concluded the appearance with a song entitled "Mr.President-Mr.President" which takes a comical look at how President [[Barack Obama]] is viewed by a segment of the population amidst domestic and foreign turmoil.On February 17 Stevens called-in to [[WSGI (AM)|WSGI]] radio's Steve Jarrell program, "Big Daddy-o on the Patio".Later that same day Stevens uploaded the much-anticipated music video of "The Skies Just Ain't Friendly Anymore".On February 18 Stevens called radio stations [[KSCJ]] and [[KDWN]] to promote the music video and to talk about politics in general.By February 24 "The Skies Just Ain't Friendly Anymore" soared past the 52,000 play mark on You Tube.On February 25 Stevens gave an interview on radio station [[WPTF]]'s Bill Lumaye program and later the same day appeared on the [[Fox Business Network]] program, [[Freedom Watch]], hosted by Judge [[Andrew Napolitano]].In the television interview Stevens offered his opinions of the current political climate, the TSA, and announced that his next single would deal with President Obama's budget plan.On February 27 the [[RFD-TV]] network reran a 1972 episode of ''[[Hee-Haw]]'' which featured Stevens as one of the guests.He performed [[Turn Your Radio On]] and [[Along Came Jones (song)|Along Came Jones]].On that same day, "The Skies Just Ain't Friendly Anymore" had amassed over 70,000 unique views on [[You Tube]] in a span of 10 days.Continuing the mostly [[talk radio]] station promotion of his TSA song Stevens called the ''Daybreak USA'' program on February 28 and on March 2 he called in to [[Ed Morrissey]]'s radio

an upcoming television show hosted by country singer [[Ronnie McDowell]] titled ''Music City Late Night''.On April 14 Stevens decided to end his subscription-based web-site, ''Ray Stevens Backstage'', after a two year run.The site was aimed at providing the most ardent of fans with exclusive content.Upon its cancellation it was revealed that elements of the ''Backstage'' site would be incorporated into the main Ray Stevens web-site.A classic music video from Ray uploaded on You Tube in 2009 but taped in 1992 entitled ''The Mississippi Squirrel Revival'' surpassed a million on-line views.This became the third music video from Stevens to obtain at least a million on-line views.On April 25 Stevens uploaded a new music video onto You Tube entitled "The Obama Budget Plan".A video clip was highlighted on [[The O'Reilly Factor]].The same day, April 25, Stevens released his latest collection of songs, ''The Spirit of '76'', which contains the previously mentioned "Obama Budget Plan", "God

series airs from the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]].The host played several of Ray's songs and often mentioned how packed the venue was and how electric the atmosphere felt.A lot of time was spent on Ray's past (his career, after all, goes back to 1957) but yet there was also discussion of Ray's current recordings and activity.Ray offered his opinions on politics and other topical issues...bringing chuckles and cheers from the host and from the audience.Several days later, on August 9, the CD copy of his digital release from April, ''Spirit of '76'', was released to wider distribution.Previously the CD copy had only been available at the singer's web-site store.On August 12 the "Obama Budget Plan" music video surpassed half a million views and by the middle of September it had surpassed 700,000 on-line views.On September 27 Stevens uploaded the music video, "Mr.President - Mr. President", and it quickly amassed more than 200,000 unique views in a little more than a week's time.A snippet of the video, during the first days of it's You Tube availability, was previewed on [[The O'Reilly Factor]].On October 7 the song was heard on [[Mark Levin]]'s

sandwiched within an actual movie.The film runs 110 minutes.The video collection "Latest and Greatest" was released in 1996.In 2000 he released "Funniest Video Characters" including the video to his 1985 song "The Ballad of the Blue Cyclone."In 2004 "Greatest Video Characters" was released...this was a large all-encompassing collection of music videos from Stevens that had been released on previous collections.Stevens' video albums are released by mail order on his own label, Clyde Records.Beginning in late 2009 Stevens began releasing new music videos directly to You Tube.A lot of the music videos released by Stevens since December 2009 are political in nature.The music videos, many of which have obtained more than half a million [[unique views]], have helped establish Stevens as a legitimate political entertainer.Stevens has 11 Grammy nominations and won two [[Grammy Award]]s: one for "Everything Is Beautiful" and one for the [[arrangement]] of his country and western version of the [[jazz standard]] "[[Misty (song)|Misty]]" (1975).Stevens was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1980 as well as the [[Georgia Music Hall of Fame]].Music City News was a monthly subscription magazine which reported on the latest happenings among country music celebrities.The magazine's subscribers for the most part voted in the annual awards.Years later fans from all over the country could call and vote for their favorite acts in addition to the subscribers who used voting ballots.The winners of the fan voted awards were showcased nationally in an awards gala broadcast on [[CBS]] and later, [[The Nashville Network]].Stevens won in the Comedian of the Year category nine consecutive years and performed on their awards telecasts on a consistent basis.Stevens was the recipient of several publisher awards from BMI Music for songs he either wrote, recorded, or published.Some of the recordings that received these citations were ''Everything Is Beautiful'', ''The Streak'', ''Shriner's Convention'', ''Gitarzan'', and several songs recorded by [[Sammy Kershaw]] and published by Stevens.In July 2009 Stevens began uploading music videos onto You Tube for the first time.Many of the uploads were of music videos that were made in the early and mid-1990s.His user name, raystevensmusic, has since released quite a few music videos on You Tube and by the late summer of 2010 a combined total of 10,000,000 unique views were obtained.[[Category:1939 births]]

Greenwood had begun studying at [[Oxford Brookes University]] when Radiohead predecessor On A Friday signed a recording contract with [[EMI]] in 1991.He left university shortly after.While Greenwood is the only member of Radiohead to have been classically trained on any instrument (he took viola lessons as a child), he is also the only band member without a university degree.Greenwood's influence on Radiohead's recording and writing can be heard in many songs, as he usually takes the traditional lead-guitarist role.For a while, Greenwood wore an arm brace due to a [[repetitive strain injury]] attributed to his "aggressive" way of playing the instrument, often billed as "abusive guitar".He has said that "It's like taping up your fingers before a boxing match."<ref></ref>Greenwood is often credited as the second major influence on songwriting in Radiohead, next to [[Thom Yorke]].He wrote the music for the closing tracks of ''[[OK Computer]]'' ("[[OK Computer|The Tourist]]"), ''[[Kid A]]'' ("[[Kid A|Motion Picture Soundtrack]]"), ''[[Amnesiac]]'' ("[[Amnesiac|Life in a Glasshouse]]") and ''[[Hail to the Thief]]'' ("A Wolf at the Door").He also wrote the intro, chorus and outro sections of the song "[[Subterranean Homesick Alien]]" from the ''[[OK Computer]]'' album, as well as the "rain down" section of "[[Paranoid Android]]".According to Yorke, the track [[Just (song)|"Just"]] from ''[[The Bends]]'' was "a competition by me and Jonny to get as many chords as possible into a song".An example of Greenwood's versatility is his use of the [[Ondes Martenot]], which is featured on songs such as "[[The National Anthem]]" and "[[How to Disappear Completely]]" from the album ''[[Kid A]]'', and "[[Pyramid Song]]" from the album ''[[Amnesiac]]''.The song "Where I End and You Begin" from ''[[Hail to the Thief]]'', which also features the instrument, was dedicated to the memory of [[Jeanne Loriod]], a pioneer of the Ondes.Greenwood and Yorke also collaborated on the song "Arpeggi" which is a piece in a classical style centered around [[arpeggios]] for voice, Ondes, and orchestra.It was performed with the [[London Sinfonietta]] and Arab Orchestra of Nazareth at the Ether Festival in March 2005

</ref> According to one of his entries on Radiohead's blog ''Dead Air Space'', Greenwood has become a [[dub reggae]] aficionado, listening as of late 2005 to little else.On the last date of [[Radiohead]]'s summer 2008 tour with [[Grizzly Bear (band)|Grizzly Bear]] in support, Greenwood spoke of his love for them on stage, saying they are his "favourite band in the world".<ref></ref>Greenwood has also stated that [[John McGeoch]] is one of his favourite guitarists.He said: "no guitarist inspired me more than John McGeoch".<ref></ref>'''

 
Greenwood has inspired many with his guitar playing and style.He is also known for his aggressive guitar playing style.Guitarists such as [[Russell Lissack]] of the English rock band [[Bloc Party]] and many others count Greenwood as an influence.Greenwood was also ranked number 60 in [[Rolling Stone]] magazine's "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"

Early on in Greenwood's career, he used a Fender Twin Reverb for clean tones.<refname="Jonny's Gear"></ref> Greenwood's Fender Eighty-Five has frequently been misidentified as a Fender Deluxe 85.It has never been confirmed that he has toured, or recorded, with a Deluxe 85.Jonny does not order the pedals on his boards in order of his signal chain, which confuses many people.He has changed pedals around and added new ones over the years, which adds to the confusion.:

  SENTENCES: '''Peter Green''' (born '''Peter Allen Greenbaum''', 29 October 1946,<ref></ref> [[Bethnal Green]], [[London]]) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[blues-rock]] [[guitarist]] and the founder of the band [[Fleetwood Mac]].Inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1998 for his work with the group, Green's compositions have been covered by artists such as [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Midge Ure]], [[Tom Petty]], and  [[Judas Priest]].<ref>http://mediawahwah.com/2010/07/14/the-tragic-tale-of-the-green-god/</ref>A major figure and bandleader in the "second great epoch"<ref name "bbking"></ref><ref></ref>

He was ranked 38th in [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'s list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time".<ref></ref>His tone on the [[John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers|Bluesbreakers]] instrumental "The Super-Natural" was rated as one of the fifty greatest of all time by ''[[Guitar Player]]''.<ref name="tones"></ref>
In June 1996 Green was voted the third-best guitarist of all time in ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine.<ref></ref><ref></ref>Green first played in a band called Bobby Denim and the Dominoes which performed pop chart covers and [[rock 'n' roll]] standards.Later he joined a [[rhythm and blues]] outfit the Muskrats, then a band called The Tridents in which he played bass.In 1966, Green played lead guitar in [[Peter Bardens]]' band "Peter B's Looners", where he met [[Mick Fleetwood]], the Looners' drummer.It was here that he made his recording début with the single "If You Wanna Be Happy / Jodrell Blues"."[[If You Wanna Be Happy]]" was an instrumental cover of a [[Jimmy Soul]] song.<refname="fmlegacy.com">http://www.fmlegacy.com/Bios/biopeter.html</ref>After three months with Bardens' group, Green had the opportunity to fill in for [[Eric Clapton]] in [[John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers]], for three concerts.Soon after, upon Clapton's departure from the Bluesbreakers, he became a full-time member of Mayall's band.Mike Vernon, a producer at Decca recalls Peter's début with the Bluesbreakers:<blockquote>
As the band walked in the studio I noticed an amplifier which I never saw before, so I said to John Mayall, "Where's Eric Clapton?" Mayall answered, "He's not with us anymore, he left us a few weeks ago."I was in a shock of state'' (sic) ''but Mayall said, "Don't worry, we got someone better."I said, "Wait a minute, hang on a second, this is ridiculous.You've got someone better??? Than Eric Clapton???" John said, "He might not be better now, but you wait, in a couple of years he's going to be the best."Then he introduced me to Peter Green.<ref name="fmlegacy.com"/></blockquote>

Green made his recording début with the Bluesbreakers on the album ''[[A Hard Road]]'' which featured two of his own compositions, "The Same Way" and "The Supernatural".The latter was one of Green's first instrumentals, which would soon become a trademark.So proficient was he that his musician friends bestowed upon him the nickname "The Green God".<ref name="bolesblues.com">http://bolesblues.com/2010/10/03/peter-green-the-green-god-with-the-holy-grail-guitar/</ref>In 1967, Green decided to form his own blues band, and left John Mayall's Bluesbreakers.[[File:Fleetwood mac peter green 2.jpg|thumb|right|Peter Green, 18 March 1970]]
Green's new band, with ex-Bluesbreaker Mick Fleetwood on drums and [[Jeremy Spencer]] on guitar was initially called "Peter Green's [[Fleetwood Mac]] featuring Jeremy Spencer".Bob Brunning was recruited for bass 
 
Although classic blues covers and blues-styled originals remained prominent in the band's repertoire through this period,  Green rapidly blossomed as a writer, contributing many successful original compositions from 1968 onwards, and the songs the chosen for single release showed Green's style gradually moving away from the group's blues roots into new musical territory.In 1968 the Mac scored a hit with Green's "[[Black Magic Woman]]", (later covered more successfully by [[Carlos Santana|Santana]]) followed by 1969's number one in the [[British Singles Chart]], the classic guitar instrumental "[[Albatross (composition)|Albatross]]".More Green-penned hits followed, including "[[Oh Well (song)|Oh Well]]", "[[Man of the World (song)|Man of the World]]" (1969 both) and the ominous "[[The Green Manalishi]]"(1970).<refname="fmlegacy.com"/>Their second studio album ''Mr.Wonderful'' continued the formula of the first album, and for their their third release, the double-LP ''Blues Jam at Chess'', the band made the pilgrimage to the legendary [[Chess Records]] Ter-Mar Studio in Chicago where, under the joint supervision of Vernon and  [[Marshall Chess]], they recorded with some of their American blues heroes including [[Otis Spann]], [[Willie Dixon]], [[J.T. Horton]] and [[Buddy Guy]].In 1970 the group signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]] and recorded their fourth studio album ''Then Play On'', which featured the group's newly recruited third guitarist [[Danny Kirwan]] 

Beginning with ''Man of the World'''s sad lyric, Green's bandmates began to notice changes in his state of mind.He took large doses of [[LSD|acid]], grew a beard, wore robes and a crucifix.Mick Fleetwood recalls Green becoming concerned about wealth: "I had conversations with Peter Green around that time and he was obsessive about us NOT making money, wanting us to give it all away.And I'd say, 'Well you can do it, I don't wanna do that, and that doesn't make me a bad person.'"<refname="fmlegacy.com"/>While touring Europe in late March 1970, Green binged on LSD at a party at a commune in [[Munich, Germany|Munich]]&mdash 

 
In late June 1970, Green appeared at the Bath Festival with John Mayall, Rod Mayall (organ) and Larry Taylor (bass).The same year he recorded a [[jam session]] entitled ''[[The End of the Game]]'' 
, 2 singles as Peter Green and Peter Green's "Beast of Burden", a gig at [[B.B. King]] [[London]] sessions in 1972, an uncredited appearance on Fleetwood Mac's "Penguin" LP in 1973, Green succumbed to mental illness, drug use and professional obscurity from which he only began to emerge in 1979.<refname "bolesblues.com"/>By this time Green had been diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]]  and he spent time in [[psychiatric hospital]]s undergoing [[electroconvulsive therapy]] during the mid 1970s.Many sources attest to his lethargic, trancelike state during this period.<ref></ref>In 1977, he was arrested for threatening his accountant, [[Clifford Davis (musician)|Clifford Davis]], with a shotgun, but the exact circumstances are the subject of much speculation, the most popular being that Green wanted Davis to stop sending money to him.However, in the BBC documentary on Green titled "Man Of The World" Green said that at the time he just returned from Canada and needed money,  upon calling up his accounts manager in the course of the conversation he alluded to the fact that he had brought back a gun from his travels 
[[File:Peter Green -Fleetwood Mac 1983.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Greenperforming on 30 May 1983]] 
In 1979 Green began to re-emerge professionally.With the help of his brother Michael he was signed to Peter Vernon-Kell's PVK label.He made an uncredited appearance on Fleetwood Mac's double-LP ''[[Tusk (album)|Tusk]]'', released that year.In 1981, he contributed to "Rattlesnake Shake" and "Super Brains" on [[Mick Fleetwood]]'s solo album ''[[The Visitor (Mick Fleetwood album)|The Visitor]]''.He recorded various sessions with a number of other musicians notably the [[Katmandu (band)|Katmandu]] album ''[[A Case for the Blues]]'' with [[Ray Dorset]] ([[Mungo Jerry]]), [[Vincent Crane]] ([[Arthur Brown (musician)|The Crazy World of Arthur Brown]]) and Len Surtees ([[The Nashville Teens]]).Despite some attempts by [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] to start talks about producing a Peter Green signature [[Les Paul (guitar)|Les Paul]] guitar, his instrument of choice at this time was a Gibson Howard Roberts Fusion.<ref></ref>In recent years Green has often been seen playing this guitar at live performances.A late 1990s comeback saw Green form the [[Peter Green Splinter Group]], with the assistance of fellow musicians including [[Nigel Watson (musician)|Nigel Watson]] and [[Cozy Powell]].The Splinter Group released nine albums between 1997 and 2004.It was in the latter part of this period that he began to play his ebony coloured Gibson Les Paul guitar again.Green signed and sold this guitar, which had been [[tweaking|tweaked]] to sound similar to his green burst model of the same guitar and is now owned by a UK guitar enthusiast.<ref></ref>Early in 2004, a tour was cancelled and the recording of a new studio album stopped, when Green left the band and moved to Sweden.<ref></ref>Shortly thereafter he joined The British Blues All Stars, for a tour scheduled for the next year.However, this tour was cancelled after the death of saxophonist [[Dick Heckstall-Smith]].At the time, Green stated that the medication he was taking to treat his psychological problems was making it hard for him to concentrate and sapped his desire to play guitar.In February 2009 he began playing and touring again, this time with [[Peter Green and Friends]].In May 2009 he was the subject for the [[BBC Four]] documentary "Peter Green: Man of the World", produced by [[HHO Multimedia|Henry Hadaway]].Green and the band subsequently played a tour of Ireland, Germany and England.The band has gone on to play several dates in Australia in March 2010, including the [[East Coast Blues & Roots Music Festival|Byron Bay Bluesfest]].The band were supported by [[Andrew Morris (singer-songwriter)]] on several of their UK tour dates in December 2009 and March 2010.<ref>http://consequenceofsound.net/2010/03/peter-green-paid-respects-at-union-chapel-322/</ref>

Green remains ambivalent about his songwriting success and more recently stated to ''Guitar Player'' magazine: {{cquote|Oh, I was never really a songwriter.I was very lucky to get those hits.I shouldn't have been distracted from my fascination with the blues...I have been known to come up with the odd bit, but I'm not all that wild about the big composer credit.}}

 
Green has been praised for his swinging shuffle grooves and soulful phrases and favoured the minor mode and its darker blues implications.<refname "tones"/>

 
Early in his career he played a [[Harmony Company|Harmony Meteor]], a cheap hollow-body guitar, but quickly started playing a [[Les Paul (guitar)|Les Paul]] with ''The Bluesbreakers'' and Green's guitar was often referred to as his "magic guitar".In 2000 he told ''[[Guitar Player]]'' magazine : "I never had a magic one.Mine wasn't magic...It just barely worked.".In part, his unique tone derived from a modification to the neck [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]] which was reversed and rewired, a modification made after 1967.On stage with [[Fleetwood Mac]], he used an [[Orange Music Electronic Company|Orange]] amplifier without any [[Guitar effects|effects]].However, there is concert footage of the band standing in front of a wall of [[Fender]] amplifiers, which appear to be ''Dual Showman Reverb'' heads with the matching two by fifteen cabinets.In the 1990s he played a 1960s [[Fender Stratocaster]] and his Gibson Howard Roberts Fusion with a [[Fender Amplifiers|Fender Blues DeVille]] and a [[Vox AC30]] amplifier.<refname="green"/>
The modification on the neck pickup was the reversal of one of the magnets,which put it out of phase.Many rock guitarists have cited Peter Green as an influence, most notably [[Gary Moore]],<ref></ref> [[Aerosmith]] guitarist [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]],<ref></ref> [[Steve Hackett]], and [[Wishbone Ash]] guitarist [[Andy Powell]].<ref></ref>
Green was Black Crowes' Rich Robinson's pick in Guitar World's "30 on 30: The Greatest Guitarists Picked by the Greatest Guitarists" (2010)<ref name="www.guitarworld.com"/>In the same article Robinson cites Jimmy Page, with whom the Crowes toured: "''...he told us so many Peter Green stories.It was clear that Jimmy loves the man’s talent.''"In an interview with Dan Forte from ''[[Guitar World]]'' magazine, which was reprinted in Guitar Legends in 1993, [[Eric Clapton]] acknowledged Green's skills as a guitar player when recalling a chance meeting with him in the mid 1980s:



In an interview with ''Guitar Player'' in 2000, Green acknowledged Clapton's influence, stating {{cquote|I followed him to John Mayall's Bluesbreakers.I loved his playing.At the time he did everything on a Telecaster.It sounded absolutely fabulous.}}

 
Green was born into a [[Jewish]] family,<ref>http://www.loti.com/sixties_music/peter_green.htm</ref> the youngest of Joe and Ann Greenbaum's four children.His brother Michael taught him his first guitar chords, and by age 11 Peter was teaching himself, going on to begin playing professionally at 15.

Enduring periods of mental illness and destitution throughout the 1970s and 1980s, punctuated by efforts at comeback, in 1991/92 he moved in with his eldest brother Len and his wife Gloria, and his mother in their house in Great Yarmouth, where a process of recovery began.<refname="fmlegacy.com"/><ref></ref>He married Jane Samuels in January 1978

  SENTENCES: '''James Corbitt Morris''' (June 20, 1907&ndash 

 
 
Driftwood was born in [[Timbo, Arkansas|Timbo]], [[Arkansas]] on June 20, 1907.His father was folk singer Neil Morris.Driftwood learned to play [[guitar]] at a young age on his grandfather's homemade instrument.Driftwood used that unique guitar throughout his career and noted that its neck was made from a fence rail, its sides from an old ox yoke, and the head and bottom from the headboard of his grandmother's bed.<ref name=ACE/> This homemade instrument produced a pleasant distinctive resonant sound.Driftwood attended [[John Brown University|John Brown College]] in northwest [[Arkansas]] and later received a degree in education from [[University of Central Arkansas|Arkansas State Teacher's College]].He started writing songs during his teaching career to teach his students history in an entertaining manner.During the 1920s and 1930s, Driftwood left Arkansas, eventually [[hitchhiking]] through the [[southwestern United States]].In [[Arizona]] he entered, and won, a local song contest.In 1936 Driftwood married Cleda Johnson, who was one of his former students, and returned to Arkansas to raise a family and resume his teaching career.During this period of his life Driftwood wrote hundreds of songs but did not pursue a musical career seriously.He wrote his later famous "Battle of New Orleans" in 1936 to help a high school class he was teaching become interested in the event.In the 1950s, he changed his name to Jimmy Driftwood, both publicly and legally.In 1957, a [[Nashville, Tennessee]] [[Music publisher (popular music)|song publisher]] learned of Driftwood, [[audition]]ed him, and signed him to his first record deal.Driftwood recalled playing some 100 of his songs in one day, of which 20 were chosen to be recorded.Driftwood's first album, ''Newly Discovered Early American Folk Songs'', received good reviews but did not sell particularly well."The Battle of New Orleans" was included on the album, but did not conform to the [[radio]] standards of the time because of the words "[[hell]]" and "[[Damnation|damn]]" in the lyrics.Driftwood said that at the time those words could be preached but not sung in secular contexts for broadcast.Driftwood was asked to make a shorter [[Censorship|censored]] version of the song for a live radio performance.Singer [[Johnny Horton]], after hearing the song, contacted Driftwood and told him that he wished to record his own version.Driftwood left Arkansas for Nashville and became popular by his appearances on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and programs including ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' and ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]''.He was invited to sing for [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] as an example of traditional American music during the leader's visit to the United States.The popular peak of Driftwood's career came in 1959  when he had no fewer than six songs on the popular and [[country music]] charts, including Johnny Horton's recording of his "The Battle of New Orleans", which remained in first place on the country music singles chart for ten weeks, and atop the popular music chart for six weeks that year.The song won the 1960 [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]].After Horton's success, Driftwood performed at [[Carnegie Hall]] and at major American folk music festivals before returning home to Timbo, Arkansas in 1962.During his recording career Driftwood also won Grammy Awards for ''Wilderness Road'', ''Songs of Billy Yank and Johnny Reb'' and ''Tennessee Stud''.Driftwood songs were [[cover song|recorded]] by [[Eddy Arnold]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Hawkshaw Hawkins]], [[Homer and Jethro]] (the [[parody]] "The Battle of Kookamonga"), [[Odetta]], [[Doc Watson]] and others.In 1958, Driftwood appeared as a guest challenger on the television game show, ''[[To Tell The Truth]]''.Driftwood for a time during the 1960s toured the United States and Europe with the [[Preservation Hall]] [[New Orleans]] [[jazz]] band, although as a separate act.Back home, he became a [[folklorist]], establishing the Rackensack Folklore Society, an association of local folk singers and musicians, and began performing at the local county fair in Mountain View.Driftwood became interested in promoting Arkansas folk music and the local folk performers he knew in the area.He invited members of the Mountain View community to perform at a festival of his own devising.This festival grew over the years, and transformed into the annual Arkansas Folk Festival which would attract more than 100,000 people.Driftwood helped establish the Ozark Folk Center to preserve [[Ozark Mountains|Ozark Mountain]] culture.The Folk Center was later absorbed into the Arkansas State Park system and remains a popular tourist destination.Driftwood became involved with environmental issues when the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] planned to dam the [[Buffalo National River|Buffalo River]].He worked to defeat the plan, which ultimately resulted in the establishment of [[Buffalo National River]].Driftwood had a major role in preserving [[Blanchard Springs Caverns]] which later came under management of the [[United States Forest Service]].He recorded the song still heard in the orientation film in the visitor center.Driftwood was appointed to direct the Arkansas Parks and Tourism Commission for his environmental efforts.He was also named to the Advisory Committee of the [[Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].Due to his extensive knowledge of folk music he was appointed as a [[musicologist]] for the [[National Geographic Society]].During his later life Driftwood enjoyed performing free concerts for [[high school]] and college students.He died of [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on July 12, 1998 in [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]], [[Arkansas]] at age 91.<ref name=ACE/>

  SENTENCES: '''Steven John Wilson''' (born 3 November 1967) is an [[English people|English]] musician, best known as the founder, [[lead guitarist]], singer and songwriter of [[progressive rock]] band [[Porcupine Tree]].He is involved in many other bands and musical projects both as musician and producer (including [[No-Man]] and [[Blackfield]]) and also maintains a solo career.Wilson is a [[Autodidacticism|self-taught]] producer, [[audio engineer]], guitar and keyboard player, playing other instruments as and where required (including [[bass guitar]], [[concert harp]], [[hammer dulcimer]] and [[flute]]).He used to split his living time between [[Tel Aviv]] and London, England,<ref></ref> but he no longer holds a permanent residence in Tel Aviv.<ref></ref>Born in [[Kingston upon Thames]], London, England<ref> </ref> (but brought up in [[Hemel Hempstead]], [[Hertfordshire]], England from the age of 6), Wilson discovered his love for music around the age of 8.It began one Christmas when his parents bought presents for each other in the form of [[Gramophone record|LPs]].His father and mother received [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' and [[Donna Summer]]'s ''[[Love to Love You Baby]]'', respectively.The young Steven spent much of his childhood listening to these albums in "heavy rotation", as he once commented.Both LPs would influence his future song writing.He claims "...in retrospect I can see how they are almost entirely responsible for the direction that my music has taken ever since."His interest in Pink Floyd led him towards [[experimental music|experimental]]/[[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] [[Concept album|conceptual]] progressive rock (as exemplified by [[Porcupine Tree]] and [[Blackfield]]), and Donna Summer's [[hypnosis|trance]]-inflected [[groove (popular music)|grooves]] inspired the initial musical approach of [[No-Man]] (Wilson's long-running collaboration with fellow musician and vocalist [[Tim Bowness]]), although the band would later develop a more meditative and experimental [[Talk Talk]]-esque approach.As a child, Steven was forced to learn the guitar, but he did not enjoy it 

 

It didn't take long before he began to form bands with his friends from school and play live.However, the activity which kept him satisfied the most was that of experimenting with sounds and producing the recordings he made.Between the years 1983 and 1986 he began to record material for release.Some of those tapes have recently resurfaced due to the increasing popularity of Porcupine Tree.Wilson describes it as "...a bit like a painter having his nursery school paint blots on display..."

One of these projects was the psychedelic duo [[Steven Wilson discography#With Altamont|Altamont]] (featuring a 15-year-old Wilson working with synth/electronics player Simon Vockings).Their one and only cassette album, ''Prayer for the Soul'', featured lyrics by British psychedelic scenester Alan Duffy, whose work Wilson would later use for two Porcupine Tree songs: "This Long Silence" and "It Will Rain for a Million Years".Around the same time that Wilson was working as Altamont, he was also in a teenaged progressive rock band called [[Steven Wilson discography#With Karma|Karma]], who played live around Hertfordshire and recorded two cassette albums, ''The Joke's On You'' (1983) and ''The Last Man To Laugh'' (1985).These contained early versions of "Small Fish", "Nine Cats" and "The Joke's On You", which were subsequently resurrected as Porcupine Tree songs.Wilson went on to join the New Wave/AOR band Pride of Passion as keyboard player, replacing former [[Marillion]] keyboard player [[Brian Jelliman]] (another former Marillion member, [[Diz Minnitt]], also played in the band).Pride of Passion would later change their name to Blazing Apostles and alter their lineup and approach, finally coming to an end in 1987.<ref></ref><ref></ref>Up to this point Wilson's diverse musical experiments had contained [[avant-garde]] and [[industrial music|industrial]] recordings, psychedelia and progressive rock.He was, however, also becoming more interested in songwriting and pop music, something that would manifest itself in his next developments.In 1986, Wilson launched the two projects that would make his name.The first of these was initially called "No Man Is An Island (Except The Isle Of Man)", although it would later be renamed "[[No-Man]]."This began life as a solo Wilson instrumental project blending progressive rock with synth pop, subsequently moving towards art-pop when singer/lyricist [[Tim Bowness]] joined the project the following year.The second project was "[[Porcupine Tree]]", which was originally a full-on pastiche of psychedelic rock (inspired by the similar [[Dukes of Stratosphear]] project by [[XTC]]) and which was carried out for the mutual entertainment of Wilson and his schoolfriend Malcolm Stocks.Over the next three years, the projects would evolve in parallel.No Man Is An Island (Except The Isle Of Man) was the first to release a commercial single (1989's "The Girl From Missouri", on Plastic Head Records), while Porcupine Tree built an increasing underground reputation via the release of a series of  cassette-only releases via The Freak Emporium (the mail-order wing of British psychedelic label [[Delerium Records]]).By 1990, No Man Is An Island (Except The Isle Of Man) had fully evolved into No-Man and was a voice/violin/multi-instrument trio which had incorporated dance beats into its art-pop sound.The second No-Man single – a crooned cover of the [[Donovan]] song "Colours" arranged in a dub-loop style anticipating [[trip-hop]] - won the Single of the Week award in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' and gained the band a recording contract with the high-profile independent label [[One Little Indian]] (at the time, famous for [[The Shamen]] and [[Björk]]).Their debut One Little Indian single, "Days In The Trees", won the same Single of the Week award the following year.The single also briefly charted and, although sales were not outstanding, Wilson had now gained credibility in the record industry (as well as enough finance to fit out his home studio with the equipment he’d need to advance his music).By this time, he’d also released the official, lavishly packaged Porcupine Tree debut album, ''[[On the Sunday of Life|On the Sunday of Life...]]''  (which compiled the best material from the underground tapes).No-Man's debut full-length release – a compilation of EP tracks called ''Lovesighs – An Entertainment'' – followed in 1992, as did Porcupine Tree's infamous LSD-themed maxi-single "[[Voyage 34]]" which made the ''[[NME]]'' [[indie (music)|indie]] [[music chart|chart]] for six weeks.<refname="Porcupine Tree Biography"></ref> No-Man also toured England with a six-piece band including three ex-members of the glam-pop band [[Japan (band)|Japan]] – [[Mick Karn]], [[Steve Jansen]] and (most significantly) [[keyboardist]] [[Richard Barbieri]].1993 saw Wilson consolidating his initial success with albums from both Porcupine Tree (''[[Up the Downstair]]'') and No-Man (''Loveblows And Lovecries – A Confession'').At the end of 1993, Porcupine Tree was launched as a four-piece live band featuring Wilson, Barbieri, bass player [[Colin Edwin]] and former No-Man live drummer [[Chris Maitland]].From this point onwards, Wilson would alternate between Porcupine Tree and No-Man releases.Although No-Man retired from live performance in 1994 (and would not return to the stage until 2006), the band continued to release a steady stream of albums featuring guests such as Barbieri, Steve Jansen, [[Robert Fripp]], [[Theo Travis]] and [[Pat Mastelotto]], and has maintained a healthy cult following as well as continued critical acclaim.Porcupine Tree, meanwhile, toured frequently (steadily gaining credibility as a consistent band) and passed through various overt phases of different musical stylings (including psychedelia, progressive rock, modern guitar rock and heavy metal) while retaining the core of Wilson's sonic imagination and songwriting.By the mid-2000s Porcupine Tree had become a highly successful rock band with albums on major labels such as Atlantic and Roadrunner, with Wilson's singing, songwriting and frontman skills increasing by the year.Also by this time, Wilson had become in-demand as a producer and was being cited as an influence by various up-and-coming musicians.During the late 90's Wilson's love of experimental, drone and ambient music began to manifest itself in a series of new projects, notably [[Bass Communion]] and [[Incredible Expanding Mindfuck]] (also known as IEM).He also began to release a series of CD singles under his own name.Having established himself as a skilled producer with a very high standard of sound engineering, Wilson was invited to produce other artists, notably the Norwegian artist [[Anja Garbarek]] and Swedish progressive-metal band [[Opeth]].Though he claims to enjoy production more than anything else, with the demands of his own projects, he has mostly restricted himself to mixing for other artists in the last few years.<ref></ref>More recently Wilson has become known for his [[5.1 Surround Sound]] mixes: the 2007 Porcupine Tree album ''[[Fear of a Blank Planet]]'' was nominated for a [[Grammy]] in the "Best Mix For Surround Sound" category.<ref></ref>The album was also voted #3 album of the year by ''[[Sound and Vision (magazine)|Sound And Vision]]''.<ref></ref>Wilson is currently working on several other surround sound projects, including remixing the [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] and [[King Crimson]] back catalogue.<ref></ref>Steven Wilson has recently begun to write reviews for the Mexican edition of the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine.They're all translated to Spanish.Two reviews have been published so far: one for [[Radiohead]]'s ''[[In Rainbows]]'' and other for [[Murcof]]'s 2007 work, ''Cosmos''.<ref></ref>He also contributes to UK magazine Classic Rock as an occasional reviewer.[[File:Porcupine Tree STEVEN WILSON TS Wisła Kraków 004.jpg|thumb|left|200px|StevenWilson photo of 2007]]
Porcupine Tree started out as a duo of Wilson and his schoolfriend Malcolm Stocks (with Wilson providing the majority of the instrumentation and Stocks contributing mostly ideas, additional vocals and experimental guitar sounds).Wilson began experimenting by recording music in his home until he had the hunch it could become someway marketable.The material was subsequently compiled into three demo tapes (''[[Tarquin's Seaweed Farm]]'', ''[[Love, Death & Mussolini]]'' and ''[[The Nostalgia Factory]]'').For the first tape, he even wrote an inlay introduction to an obscure (imaginary) band called "The Porcupine Tree", suggesting the band met in the early '70s at a rock festival, and they had been in and out of prison many times.The booklet also contained information about band's obscure members like Sir Tarquin Underspoon and Timothy Tadpole-Jones, and crew members like Linton Samuel Dawson (if put into initials forming [[LSD]]).Wilson: "It was a bit of fun.But of course like anything that starts as a joke, people started to take it all seriously!".<ref name="DPRP"></ref> When Wilson signed to [[Delerium Records|Delerium]] label, he selected what he considered the best tracks from these early tapes.All those songs were mastered and made up Porcupine Tree's first official studio album, ''[[On the Sunday of Life|On the Sunday of Life...]]''.Quickly after, Wilson would release the [[Single (music)|single]] "[[Voyage 34]]", a thirty-minute long piece that could be described as a mixture of [[ambient (music)|ambient]], [[trance (music)|trance]] and [[psychedelia]].This was done partly as an attempt to produce the longest single yet released, which it was until it was later exceeded by The Orb's "Blue Room."With non-existent radio play "Voyage 34" still managed to enter the ''[[NME]]'' [[indie (music)|indie]] [[music chart|chart]] for six weeks and became an underground [[Relaxation technique|chill-out]] classic.<refname="Porcupine Tree Biography"/>

The second full-length album, ''[[Up the Downstair]]'' (though Wilson considers it the first 'proper' PT album since it was made as such and not simply compiled), was released in 1993 and had a very good reception, praised by ''[[Melody Maker]]'' as "a psychedelic masterpiece... one of the albums of the year".<ref></ref> This was the first album to include ex-[[Japan (band)|Japan]] member, [[keyboardist]] [[Richard Barbieri]] and [[Australian]]-born [[bassist]] [[Colin Edwin]].About the end of the year, Porcupine Tree became a full band for the first time with the inclusion of [[Chris Maitland]] on [[Drum kit|drums]].Wilson continued exploring the ambient and trance grounds and issued ''[[The Sky Moves Sideways]]''.It also entered the ''NME'', ''Melody Maker'', and ''[[Music Week]]'' charts<ref name "DPRP"/>

The band's fourth work, ''[[Signify]]'', included the first full-band compositions and performance, which resulted in less use of drum machines and a more full-band sound.It can be considered a departure from its predecessors for a more song-oriented style.<ref></ref>After the release of the live album ''[[Coma Divine - Recorded Live in Rome|Coma Divine]]'' concluded their deal with Delerium in 1997, the band moved to [[Snapper Music|Snapper]] and issued two poppier albums, ''[[Stupid Dream]]'' in 1999 and ''[[Lightbulb Sun]]'' in 2000.Both were critical successes and only increased their popularity in the underground music scene.Two years would pass until their sixth studio album, and in the meantime the band switched labels again, this time signing to [[Lava Records|Lava]], and drummer [[Chris Maitland]] was replaced by [[Gavin Harrison]].Now with the support of a major label, ''[[In Absentia]]'' saw the light of day in 2002, featuring a heavier sound than all the group's previous works.It charted in many European countries and remains one of the top-selling Porcupine Tree albums by now 

Steven Wilson started writing Porcupine Tree's next album in early 2006 in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]], alongside work on the second album for his side-project [[Blackfield]].Writing sessions finished in London, UK, in June 2006, then in August of the same year, the band released their first live [[DVD]], titled ''[[Arriving Somewhere...]]'' and started a tour between September and November to promote it, during which the first half of each show was made up of all-new material.When the tour concluded the band went to studio and finished recording and mastering and added the last touches to the album.In early January 2007, the band revealed the album title was going to be ''[[Fear of a Blank Planet]]'' (a deliberate reference to Public Enemy's ''[[Fear of a Black Planet]]''), and the concept was influenced by the [[Bret Easton Ellis]] novel [[Lunar Park]].The album hit the shops on 16 April 2007 in Europe and April 24 in USA.The lyrics revolve around common 21st Century issues such as technology alienation, teen violence, prescription drugs, [[attention deficit disorder]] and [[bipolar disorder]].''Fear of a Blank Planet'' resulted in the most successful album to date in terms of market and sales, and also received the most favourable reviews of the band's whole career.It entered the Billboard 200 at #59, and charted in almost all European countries, peaking at #31 in the UK.It was nominated for a US [[Grammy]], and won several polls as the best album of the year (e.g.''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' magazine, Aardshock, The Netherlands).In July 2007 the ''Nil Recurring'' EP was released, containing other material that hadn't made it onto the album for one reason or another.At a European show in August 2008, Wilson said that Porcupine Tree was beginning work on material for their next album with an eye toward a release in 2009.<ref></ref>Consisting of one long 55 minute song along with 4 shorter songs on the second disc, [[The Incident (album)|The Incident]] was released on September 14, 2009.''The Incident'' is a double CD set containing the self-titled 55 minute song cycle on disc 1.It has received significant attention and media coverage, and achieved for the band their highest chart positions to date, reaching 5 in The Netherlands, 9 in Germany, 23 in the UK, and 25 on the Billboard 200 in the USA.The subsequent tour of the US and Europe highlighted a large increase in the band's following, with many shows sold out.The single from ''The Incident'', "Time Flies" was available as the free download from Itunes for one week in October 2009.<ref></ref>A new DVD release is expected in Spring 2010, and a preview appeared on the band's website in April 2010.No-Man is Wilson's long term collaboration with singer and songwriter [[Tim Bowness]].Influenced by everything from ambient music to hip-hop, their early singles and albums were a mixture of dance beats and lush orchestrations.However, after a few years the duo started to create more textural and experimental music, most comparable with later [[Talk Talk]].Beginning with ''[[Flowermouth]]'' in 1994, they have worked with a very wide palette of sounds, and many guest musicians, blending balladry with both acoustic and electronic sounds.No-Man was the first Wilson project to achieve any degree of success, signing with UK independent label [[One Little Indian]] (the label of [[Björk]], [[The Shamen]] and [[Skunk Anansie]] among others), and releasing a string of critically acclaimed singles.The band remains an ongoing, predominantly studio-based project and continues to produce material, although it has never achieved the same level of commercial success as Porcupine Tree.In 1996 came the first in a series of albums by I.E.M. (The Incredible Expanding Mindfuck, a name which had also been considered for Porcupine Tree in its infancy), dedicated to exploring Wilson's love of [[krautrock]] and experimental rock music.Initially Wilson had planned for the project to be anonymous, but then label Delerium Records published a song on their Pick N Mix compilation with the composition credited to "Steven Wilson" and so attempts to pass off the project in this way were abandoned.<ref></ref>The project released 2 more albums ''[[Arcadia Son]]'', and ''[[IEM Have Come For Your Children]]'', both in 2001.A box set of 4 CDs, consisting of everything Wilson recorded under the name - billed as "an homage and a final farewell to I.E.M." - was released in June 2010.In 1998 Wilson launched another solo project Bass Communion, dedicated to recordings in an [[ambient music|ambient]], [[drone music|drone]], and/or electronic vein.The atmosphere of the music has tended towards the dark and melancholic, but expressed with an almost Zen-like beauty.More recently Wilson has also started working with a guitar and laptop configuration to create fuzzy power drones.So far there have been several full length Bass Communion CDs, vinyl LPs, and singles, many of them issued in handmade or limited editions (which sell out very quickly) in elaborate packaging.Bass Communion has collaborated with many leading experimental musicians such as [[Muslimgauze]], [[Robert Fripp]], [[Vidna Obmana]] (on the ongoing [[Continuum (music project)|Continuum]] project), Jonathan Coleclough, Colin Potter, [[Andrew Liles]], and several others.[[Image:Blackfield-NYC-01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|StevenWilson during a Blackfield performance at New York, in 2005]]

 

In 2001 Wilson met and began to collaborate with [[Israelis|Israeli]] [[rock music|rock]] star [[Aviv Geffen]], with whom he created the band [[Blackfield]].Since then the duo have released three highly acclaimed albums of what they refer to as "melodic and melancholic rock".The albums spawned several hits, notably "Blackfield", "Pain" and "Once".The band has toured several times, and a live DVD of their show in New York was released in 2007.A third album, titled "[[Welcome to my DNA]]" was released on 28 March 2011 with a European and American tour to follow.In March 2010 Wilson and [[Mikael Åkerfeldt]], the front man of ''[[Opeth]]'' decided to work on a new project as a collaboration under the name of ''Storm Corrosion''.the self-titled album is set to be released in April 2012 on ''[[Roadrunner Records]]''.Some part of recordings took its part from ''Opeth'''s 2011 album ''[[Heritage (Opeth album)|Heritage]]'' and Steven's 2011 album ''Grace for Drowning''.Between 2003 and 2010 Wilson released a series of six two-track CD singles under his own name, each one featuring a cover version and an original Steven Wilson song.The choice of covers is unpredictable, featuring songs by Canadian singer [[Alanis Morissette]], Swedish pop group [[Abba]], UK rock band [[The Cure]], Scottish songwriter [[Momus (artist)|Momus]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], and Scottish singer/songwriter [[Donovan]].Separate from the ''Cover Versions'' series, Wilson has also contributed a cover version of the [[Cardiacs]] song "Stoneage Dinosaurs" to ''[[Leader Of The Starry Skies: A Tribute To Tim Smith, Songbook 1]]'' (a fundraising compilation album released in December 2010 to benefit the hospitalised [[Cardiacs]] leader [[Tim Smith (musician)|Tim Smith]], whom Wilson has cited as a major inspiration spiritually, if not necessarily in style).<ref>http://www.thegenepool.co.uk/items/597.htm</ref>In November 2008 Wilson released his first official solo album, ''[[Insurgentes (album)|Insurgentes]]'', recorded all over the world between January–August, as a double CD plus a DVD-A (limited to 3,000 copies) and a 4 x 10&nbsp 

Lasse Hoile's full length feature version of the film based on the recording of the album was premiered at the CPH:DOX international film festival in Copenhagen in November 2009.The film will also be screened at film festivals in Sweden, Germany, Mexico, USA, and Canada.The film is described as part documentary / part surreal road movie.Lasse also directed a video for the song Harmony Korine from the Insurgentes album - the video was a homage to some of Steven and Lasse's favourite European art house films, and has been nominated for Best Cinematography Award and Best Music Video Award at the prestigious Plus Camerimage - International Film Festival of the Art of Cinematography Awards.A remix mini album was released in November, featuring remixes of material from Insurgentes by TV on the Radio's David A. Sitek, Dälek, Engineers, [[Pat Mastelotto]], and [[Fear Falls Burning]].Wilson's second album, ''[[Grace For Drowning]]'', was released in September 2011 in CD, vinyl and blu-ray formats.<ref></ref>It is a double album, with the individual parts named ''Deform to Form a Star'' and ''Like Dust I Have Cleared From My Eye''.<ref></ref>He also announced his first solo tour, in Europe and North America, to promote his solo albums.The tour will take place in October and November 2011 and will contain songs from both ''Insurgentes'' and ''Grace for Drowning''.Steven has released his latest solo album in September 2011.It came in the form of two separate albums packaged together, titled ''Deform To Form A Star'' and ''Like Dust I Have Cleared From My Eye''.The two separate albums named above are gathered under the name ''[[Grace For Drowning]]''.The [http://www.gracefordrowning.comwebsite] currently holds much information about the new album.Steven is also recording a collaborative album with [[Sweden|Swedish]] band [[Opeth]]'s singer, guitarist and composer [[Mikael Åkerfeldt]] tentatively titled Storm Corrosion.On March 2011, Steven revealed on his Facebook account, that: <blockquote>"Firstly, we finished mixing the incredible new Opeth album a few days ago, [sic] Mikael and I also took the opportunity while he was here to finish writing our collaboration album - there's still a lot of recording work to do, but this should definitely be out in early 2012."</blockquote><ref></ref>Steven has also worked on and off on a new Bass Communion album called Cenotaph.He [[record producer|produced]] and contributed [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]], [[guitar]] and [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]] for [[Opeth]] on the albums ''[[Blackwater Park]]'', ''[[Deliverance (Opeth album)|Deliverance]]'', and ''[[Damnation (album)|Damnation]]''.In addition to this, he has collaborated on many projects with Belgian experimental musician Dirk Serries of [[Vidna Obmana]] and [[Fear Falls Burning]], most notably on their collaboration project [[Continuum (music project)|Continuum]] which has so far produced two albums.Wilson is also featured on a Fovea Hex EP "Allure" (Part 3 of the "Neither Speak Nor Remain Silent" trilogy of EP's) on bass guitar.This EP was released in April 2007 through Die-Stadt Musik.Steven Wilson has also worked with [[OSI (band)|OSI]], [[Marillion]], [[JBK (music)|JBK]], [[Orphaned Land]], [[Paatos]], [[Theo Travis]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[Fish (singer)|Fish]], [[Cipher]] and [[Anja Garbarek]] performing songwriting duties as well as performing musically.Most recently, Wilson is featured on the [[Pendulum (band)|Pendulum]] album "[[Immersion (album)|Immersion]]", with his vocals featuring on "The Fountain".<ref>http://twitter.com/rob_swire</ref>He made a guest appearance on [[Dream Theater]]'s 2007 album, ''[[Systematic Chaos]]'' on the song "[[Repentance (song)|Repentance]]", as one of several musical guests recorded apologizing to important people in their lives for wrongdoings in the past.Wilson did an interview with German musician and [[composer]] [[Klaus Schulze]].Schulze was an important figure of the [[Krautrock]] movement.This interview is featured as bonus material in Schulze's Live DVD, ''Rheingold''.<ref>[http://www.myspace.com/klausschulzerheingoldMySpace.com - Klaus Schulze Rheingold DVD].Rheingold DVD's MySpace (2008-09-11).Retrieved on 2008-10-07.</ref>The most recent [[Anathema (band)|Anathema]] album, ''[[We're Here Because We're Here]]'', was mixed by Wilson in a period beginning January 2010 and he is thanked in the album liner notes.<ref></ref>A current ongoing project for Wilson is remixing the back catalogue of [[King Crimson]] from 1969 to 1984 into MLP (Meridian Lossless Packaging) 5.1 and new stereo mixes.<refname="News"></ref>   The first three new editions were issued in October 2009, with more emerging in batches over the coming years.<ref>http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/news/Steven-Wilson-On-Remixing-King-Crimson-20442.aspx</ref>For live shows Wilson plays with bare feet.This particular custom goes back to his early childhood, where he remembers: "I always had a problem wearing shoes and I've always gone around with bare feet".<refname = Rockeyez></ref> He also adds that another factor on performing barefoot is the advantage it gives in operating his diverse guitar pedals.<ref></ref>Wilson: <blockquote>"I’ve stepped on nails, screws, drawing pins, stubbed my toe, I’ve come off stage with blood just coming out… I mean, I’ve had it all mate, but to be honest, nothing's going to stop me."<refname = Rockeyez/></blockquote>

  SENTENCES: '''Vassar Clements''' (April 25, 1928 – August 16, 2005) was a [[Grammy Award]]- winning [[United States|American]] [[Jazz music|jazz]], [[Swing music|swing]], and [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] [[fiddler]].Clements has been dubbed the Father of Hillbilly Jazz, an improvisational style that blends and borrows from swing, hot jazz, and bluegrass along with roots also in country and other musical traditions.Clements was born in [[Kinard, Florida|Kinard]],<ref>Source: [http://www.imdb.it/name/nm0166269/Internet Movie Database]</ref> but grew up in [[Kissimmee, Florida|Kissimmee]], [[Florida]].He taught himself to play the fiddle at age 7 and the first song he learned was "There's an Old Spinning Wheel in the Parlor".Soon, Clements formed a local string band with two first cousins, Red and Gerald.Gerald was the fiddle player and when he got married and left, Clements had to pick up the fiddle.In his early teens, he met [[Bill Monroe]] and the [[Blue Grass Boys]] when they came to [[Florida]] to visit Clements' stepfather who knew [[Chubby Wise]].Clements heard Wise play and was impressed.In late 1949, when Wise left Monroe, Clements, who was then only 21, travelled by bus to ask for an audition.When told he would have to return the next day, Clements was crestfallen because he didn't have any money for a hotel room or even for a return bus trip.Monroe gave him some money to a night's lodging, and the next day Clements auditioned and was hired as Wise's replacement in the Blue Grass Boys.He remained with Monroe for seven years.During this period he recorded with Bill Monroe and the Bluegrass Boys in 1950 and 1951.Vassar Clements soon became one of the most distinctive, inventive, and popular fiddlers in bluegrass music.His virtuosity and ability to blend several different genres, including swing and hot jazz, into his style made him a pioneer in country music and much sought after session musician.He didn't always earn his living playing music.In the mid-1960s he struggled with, and recuperated from alcohol.During this period he made his living employed briefly at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] in [[Florida]], where he worked on plumbing.He also performed several other [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar jobs]] including work in a [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] [[paper mill]], as switchman for [[Atlantic Coast Line Railroad]] 

Between 1957 and 1962, he was a member of the [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] band [[Jim and Jesse]] & the Virginia Boys.Returning to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in 1967, he became a much sought after [[studio musician]].After a brief touring stint with [[Faron Young]] he joined [[John Hartford]]'s Dobrolic Plectral Society in 1971 when he met guitarist [[Norman Blake (American musician)|Norman Blake]] and [[Dobro]] player [[Tut Taylor]], and recorded ''[[Aereo-plain|Aereo-Plain]]'', a widely acclaimed "newgrass" album that helped broaden the bluegrass market and sound.After less than a year he joined [[Earl Scruggs]], who first earned widespread renown playing with [[Lester Flatt]] 

His 1972 work with the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] on their album ''[[Will the Circle Be Unbroken]]'' earned even wider acclaim, and he later worked on the [[Grateful Dead]]'s ''[[Wake of the Flood]]'' and [[Jimmy Buffett]]'s ''[[A White Sport Coat and a Pink Crustacean]]''.Within the next two years, Clements would cut his first solo album.In 1974, he joined [[Jerry Garcia]], [[David Grisman]], [[Peter Rowan]] and [[John Kahn]] in releasing the bluegrass album, ''[[Old and in the Way]]''.That same year he lent his talents to ''[[Highway Call]]'', a solo album by former [[Allman Brothers Band]] guitarist [[Dickey Betts]].He was considered by many to be an outstanding fiddle virtuoso and he described his talent saying, 


In his 50-year career he played with artists ranging from [[Woody Herman]] and the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] to the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Linda Ronstadt]] and [[Paul McCartney]], and earned at least five [[Grammy Award]] nominations and numerous professional accolades.He once recorded with the pop group [[the Monkees]] by happenstance, when he stayed behind after an earlier recording session.He also appeared in [[Robert Altman]]'s 1975 film ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' and [[Alan Rudolph]]'s 1976 film, ''[[Welcome to L.A.]]''.He made a duet album with Stephane Grappelli ''[[Together At Last]]'' in 1992.In 2004 he performed in concert with jazz quartet Third Stream - in which a video documentary of the concert was done with Jim Easton guitar, Tom Strohman sax, Jim Miller bass and John Peifer drums http://www.vassarclements.com/tourdates_2004.htmlThough he played numerous instruments, Clements indicated that he chose the fiddle over guitar recalling that, "I picked up a guitar and fiddle and tried them both out.The guitar was pretty easy, but I couldn't get nothing out of the fiddle.So every time I'd see those instruments sitting side by side, I'd grab that fiddle."[[Big band]] and [[swing music]] were considerable influences upon his style and musical development, and he said that, "Bands like [[Glenn Miller]], [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Harry James]] and [[Artie Shaw]] were very popular when I was a kid.I always loved rhythm, so I guess in the back of my mind the swing and jazz subconsciously comes out when I play, because when I was learning I was always trying to emulate the big-band sounds I heard on my fiddle."Vassar Clements played on over 200 albums, including nearly 40 on which he starred or was featured.His albums often featured newgrass style music and what Clements called "Hillbilly Jazz".His last album, ''Livin' With the Blues'', released in 2004, was his only blues recording 

His 2005 [[Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance]]
was for "Earl's Breakdown," by the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]], and featured Clements, [[Earl Scruggs]], Randy Scruggs and [[Jerry Douglas (musician)|Jerry Douglas]].Clements, whose last performance was February 4, 2005 in [[Jamestown, New York|Jamestown]], [[N.Y.]], died on August 16, 2005 at age 77 of [[lung cancer]] that had spread to his brain.<references />

  SENTENCES: '''Andrew Piran "Andy" Bell''' (born 11 August 1970) is a Welsh musician, currently playing guitar in the band [[Beady Eye]].He is a songwriter, singer, producer, DJ and former member of the early 1990s [[shoegazing]] band, [[Ride (band)|Ride]], and later, [[Hurricane No. 1|Hurricane #1]].He is also well known as the bass guitarist for the British rock band [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]].Bell formed [[Ride (band)|Ride]] with [[Mark Gardener]] ([[guitarist]]), whom he met at [[Cheney School]] in [[Oxford]] and Laurence Colbert ([[drummer]]) and Steve Queralt ([[bassist]]), whom he met doing Foundation Studies in Art and Design at Banbury in 1988.While still at Banbury the band produced a tape demo including the tracks "Chelsea Girl" and "Drive Blind".In February 1989, Ride were asked to stand in for a cancelled student union gig at [[Oxford Brookes University|Oxford Polytechnic]] that brought them to the attention of [[Alan McGee]].After supporting The Soup Dragons in 1989 McGee then signed them to [[Creation Records]].This was a key musical event in Bell's life.With Ride, Bell released three [[Extended play|EPs]] between January and September 1990, entitled ''[[Ride (EP)|Ride]]'', ''[[Play (EP)|Play]]'' and ''[[Fall (Ride EP)|Fall]]''.While the EPs were not chart successes, enough critical praise was received to make Ride the darlings of music journalists.The first two EPs were eventually released together as ''[[Smile (Ride album)|Smile]]'' in 1992, while the ''Fall'' EP was later incorporated into CD releases of their debut LP, ''[[Nowhere (album)|Nowhere]]'', released in October 1990, which was hailed as a critical success, with the media dubbing Ride "the brightest hope" for 1991.''Nowhere'' was followed in March 1992 with ''[[Going Blank Again]]''.The twin rhythm guitars of Bell and Gardener, both distorted, both using Wah-wah pedals and both feeding back on each other was seen as the highlight of the album's critical and chart success.Despite having a solid fanbase and some mainstream success, the lack of a breakthrough contributed to inter-band tension, especially between Gardener and Bell.Their third LP, ''[[Carnival of Light (album)|Carnival of Light]]'', was released in 1994, after shoegazing had given way to [[Britpop]].''Carnival of Light'' was oriented towards this new sound, but sales were sluggish and the shift in musical tastes devastated much of their original audience.The band were joined at Creation Records by Oasis, who shot to fame in 1994 with their debut ''[[Definitely Maybe]]''.As label mates, Bell came to know the band's Gallagher brothers well and often shared in their partying, if not their success.1995 saw the dissolution of the band while recording their fourth album, ''[[Tarantula (Ride album)|Tarantula]]'', due to creative and personal tensions between the two guitarists.Bell penned most of the songs for the album, one of which - "Castle on the Hill" - was a lament for the band's situation and contains references to Gardener's self imposed exile from the group.Upon release of the album, it was announced that it would be [[Deletion (music industry)|deleted]] after one week.Since the break-up, both Bell and Gardener have been more reflective on the reasons why the group disintegrated, with Bell especially admitting his own part in the process.It appears that they had just been too young and too stubborn and had no real idea of where the band was heading when they changed their style.<ref>[http://www.creation-records.com/ride/andy.htmlwww.creation-records.com/rideExclusive<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

 
Bell returned in 1997 with [[Hurricane No.1|Hurricane #1]], another Creation signing.Aware of his own vocal fragility, Bell had drafted in a more gutsy singer, [[Alex Lowe (musician)|Alex Lowe]], who would sing the songs Bell wrote for him.The same year, they released their first album, also called ''Hurricane #1''.Their first single, "Step Into My World", number 29 in the UK charts (a re-mix of reached number 19 that year), and other less successful singles "Just Another Illusion" and "Chain Reaction".Their second album, ''[[Only The Strongest Will Survive]]'', was released in 1998 and the title track was released as a single reaching number 19.

Hurricane #1 drew criticism, bordering on ridicule, for their similarity to Oasis.Bell himself said "Hurricane #1 is not so much influenced by Oasis, it's inspired by Oasis".Their albums did not sell well and in 1999 Bell took time out to tour as guitarist with the band [[Gay Dad]].During 1999<ref>[http://www.undertheradarmag.com/issue4/ride.html]</ref> with [[Hurricane No. 1|Hurricane #1]] on hiatus Bell moved from [[Oxford]] to live with his wife [[Idha]] and daughter in [[Sweden]].Bell was invited to join [[Oasis(band)|Oasis]] because they were looking for replacements for founding members [[Paul Arthurs|Bonehead]] and [[Guigsy]].At the last minute Bell had to learn to play bass as well as the entire Oasis catalogue before his first Oasis gig.As he had no part in performing on Oasis' 2000 album ''[[Standing on the Shoulder of Giants]]'', he was originally paid the wage of a touring musician – about £85 a night.Since joining Oasis, Andy Bell regularly made songwriting contributions to the band.Noel Gallagher quit Oasis in August 2009, following an argument with his brother in Paris.Gallagher placed part of the blame for his decision to leave on Bell, and Gem Archer for a lack of support saying "the lack of support and understanding from my... band mates has left me with no other option than to get me cape and seek pastures new."According to Gallagher, he is still on friendly terms with Archer and Chris Sharrock, however he has not spoken with his brother or Bell since.<br>Following the demise of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] Andy Bell is now a full-time member of the band [[Beady Eye]], together with former [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] members [[Gem Archer]] and [[Liam Gallagher]] who are joined by drummer [[Chris Sharrock]].For [[Beady Eye]] Andy Bell has changed from playing bass (as he did in Oasis), to play [[guitar]] both live and in the studio for the band- as he had previously done for both [[Ride (band)|Ride]] and [[Hurricane#1]].Beady Eye's debut album ''[[Different Gear, Still Speeding]]'' contains four songs written by Andy Bell and subsequently developed by the band, namely 'Four Letter Word', 'Millionaire', 'Kill For A Dream' and 'The Beat Goes On'.In addition to being a [[songwriter]] and [[musician]], Bell has for a number of years  actively been involved in record production.He receives co-production credit for both albums recorded by Hurricane#1- the eponymous Hurricane#1 and Only The Strongest Will Survive.<ref>Hurricane#1& Only The Strongest Will Surive album sleevenotes.</ref>During late 1995, after the sessions for ''[[Tarantula (Ride album)|Tarantula]]'' were completed but prior to the official announcement of Ride's breakup, Bell undertook [[Record producer|production]] duties on [[Britpop]] band [[The Kynd]]'s debut single "[[Egotripper]]", which was released in October 1996.<ref></ref>Bell also undertook production duties for the fifth studio album ''Fear & Love'' by [[Sweden|Swedish]] band [[Weeping Willows]]<ref>Discography section of weepingwillows.nu</ref>released in 2007 Weeping Willows has always drawn upon early [[Roy Orbison]] and [[The Smiths]] as their main influences.On ''Fear & Love'', Bell brought some English [[folk music]] influences, and a some 1960s styled [[British Invasion]] sounds.The album was more or less recorded live in the studio, by playing the songs until the band got them right with minimal digital post production.Weeping Willows last two albums relied on a lot of post-production and remix styled studio techniques.Scandinavian music critics have given the album a warm welcome and compared some songs to [[The Coral]], [[The Verve]], [[Talk Talk]] and Oasis.Bell has been good friends with Magnus Carlson, the lead singer in Swedish band, [[Weeping Willows]], together they have embarked on some musical projects.The two run and [[Disc jockey|DJ]] at the [[nightclub|club]], Bangers 'n' Mash.<ref></ref>Bell, also undertakes occasional [[Disc jockey|DJ]] sets in [[United Kingdom|UK]] clubs, for example, 'This Feeling' night club night in [[London]].<ref>[http://www.nme.com/news/oasis/31413Oasis man set to DJ in London]</ref>
